"Hold your arm out flat in front of you with your elbow bent. The top of your forearm should form a level surface. Apply a line of lotion from the back of your hand up your arm almost to the crease of your elbow. Squeeze lotion onto both forearms.  Do not rub the lotion into your arms, rather let it sit on your arm in the line you squeezed. You can use as much or as little lotion as you feel is necessary to cover your back completely. Bend your elbows and reach both of your arms behind you, placing the lotion covered forearms against your back. Depending on how flexible you are, this may hurt a little. It might be easier to place one arm behind your back at a time. If you have shoulder pain or are not very flexible, this method may not work well for you. Rub your forearms and the backs of your hands up and down your back like windshield wipers covering as much of your back as you can. You can use your left arm first to cover your left side and then place your right arm behind and use it to cover the right side of your back. Repeat this process as necessary if you don’t feel like you got enough lotion on your back.

",Squeeze a line of lotion onto the tops of both forearms and the backs of your hands. Place your arms behind your back. Move your arms in a windshield wiper motion.
"As you continue playing, surviving becomes painful, and eating Cooked Morsel, Frog Legs, and Berries won't be enough. Food you gathered are also easily spoiled and with hardly enough good effect on health. You need a Crock Pot to have better food for health regeneration.  A Crock Pot is a contraption that lets you combine and cook four food items into a recipe. Craft it with 3 Cut Stones, 6 Charcoal, and 6 Twigs using the Alchemy Engine. Get Cut Stones from 3 Rocks using the Science Machine. Charcoal can be gathered from burnt trees. If there are no burnt trees around, look for a small patch of trees (preferably far from the thick forest), and torch them down. Twigs can be used as filler for some foods in the Crock Pot. There are lots of food you can whip up with your Crock Pot, and it's not really necessary to use 4 food items for a meal. For example, you only need Frog Legs and a Mushroom and 2 Twigs for a Froggle Bunwich. An Alchemy Engine is a craftable science structure that unlocks more crafting recipes to aid in your survival. With much more powerful weapons and tougher armor, you can withstand any Hound attack and increase your chances of survival, especially during harsh winters.  To create an Alchemy Engine, you need 6 Gold, 4 Boards, and 2 Cut Stones. With the Alchemy Engine, create an Ice Box where you can store your food, thereby reducing the spoilage rate by 50%. An Ice Box requires 2 Gold, 1 Board, and 1 Gear. You can gather Gear from clockwork monsters. Having a Farm is possible in the game. Weapons, armor, and other items can be crafted easily with the proper materials gathered around the world. A Farm, however, requires patience, and you need seeds to plant.  To have a really good and fast harvest, you need an Improved Farm, which can be crafted with 10 Cut Grass, 6 Manure, and 4 Rocks using the Alchemy Machine. Manure can be found and gathered by exploring a Beefalo Field when you chance upon one. Beefalo herds can be found in Savanna biomes and won't attack you unless provoked. You can also use Manure as fertilizer for your plants. Farming seeds give you random results, with plants producing either vegetables or fruits. Now that you have the essentials, you can survive the game for days. Just make sure you've built walls around your base, and you have enough food in your Ice Box. Explore the area to unravel its mysteries, and gather what you need for your next weapon and armor. Keep in mind that going up a level will have you starting all over again.

"You should know that vaginoplasty can treat a prolapsed bladder. The muscles of the vagina play a crucial role in holding pelvic organs in place. When your vaginal muscles slacken, they may not do so effectively, and one of the potential consequences is a cystocele, or prolapsed bladder. This is a condition, fairly common in women, in which the bladder sinks into the vagina. If you have a prolapsed bladder, your doctor may recommend vaginoplasty as a solution.  Cystoceles are divided into categories based on severity. In Grade 1, or “mild” cases, only a small part of the bladder descends into the vagina. These cases may not need any treatment at all, unless they cause troubling symptoms. In Grade 2, or “moderate” cases, the bladder descends far enough into the vagina to touch the vaginal opening. In Grade 3, or “severe” cases, the bladder descends so far that it actually begins to protrude through the vaginal opening. If you are considering vaginoplasty for a prolapsed bladder, understand that less invasive treatments may work for you, especially if your case is not severe. Some women who don’t have bladder pursue vaginoplasty as a solution for vaginal muscles that have become extremely weak. If your vaginal muscles have slackened to the point at which medical problems might result, your doctor may suggest vaginoplasty. Depending on the severity of your condition, this surgery might seem like a good option for you.  There are many reasons that vaginal muscles can weaken over time. Childbirth is a common factor, as is going through menopause. Women can also experience weakened vaginal muscles as a complication from a previous surgery. Weak vaginal muscles can also be hereditary. Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing problems such as vaginal pain or incontinence. Make sure to discuss your options outside of surgery. Non-invasive options include using a pessary to hold the pelvic organs in place, taking estrogen replacement therapy, and doing Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor Sex is an important part of a healthy lifestyle for many women. If your vaginal muscles become very weak, you may struggle to achieve orgasm or feel that your orgasms are less satisfying. Vaginoplasty tightens the muscles of the vagina, allowing them to contract more effectively.  Vaginoplasty can improve your sex life. However, this is not the main reason to seek surgery. Typically, enhanced pleasure from vaginoplasty is a side-effect from having the surgery for another medical issue. It is an important benefit of this surgery. Increased sexual pleasure can lead to greater self-confidence and reduced levels of stress. Talk to your doctor about your individual issues. Many women worry that their vaginas are too slack or “stretched out” as they age or after they have children. This is normal.  It’s true that both age and childbirth can weaken the muscles of the vagina and make you feel a little “looser,”, but in most cases, this is not a severe medical issue.  The rise of “vaginal rejuvenation” as a cosmetic procedure has made many women feel that their vaginas need to be improved with surgery, but for most women, this is simply not the case. Many times, the problem effects your self-esteem more than anything else. Work with your partner to revive your sex life. Don't worry about what other people think. Having surgery because someone else says that you should is not a great reason. If you are in the process of transitioning from male to female, you might want to consider surgery. To finalize the physical transition, many people choose to have a penile inversion vaginoplasty. Talk to your doctor about the process.  Make sure that you discuss the physical preparation for this surgery. You will need to be on hormone therapy for a period of time before having the surgery. Many doctors will recommend an extended course of counseling. This ensures that you understand the emotional connotations of having this surgery.

"If you want to gather data on the frequency of something, then graphing a histogram is a good way to look at your data. Whether you’re looking at the number of copies sold of a specific book or the weight distribution of cows on a farm, histograms are an easy way to get a broad picture of the overall pattern of the distribution of the data. When plotting the data, you must first decide how you want to divide it up into ranges. You want to choose bins that will give you a good representation, so you don’t want them to be too broad or too specific.  For example, let’s say you had 10 data points of the weight of cows on your farm: 1150, 1400, 1100, 1600, 1800, 1550, 1750, 1350, 1400, and 1300. These weights vary by hundreds of pounds, so you want your bins to vary by hundreds of pounds as well. Set bins every 200 pounds, starting at 1100 pounds going up to 1900 pounds. 1100-1300, 1300-1500, 1500-1700, 1700-1900 for a total of 4 bins. Once you have chosen your bins, you need to order and sort the data into these bins. Start by putting all of your values in ascending order. Then draw a line at the division of the bins. Count the number of values that fall into each bin. This number is the frequency of each range.  Remember, if the value is equal to the boundary of a bin, it falls in the bin to the right.  For example, let’s say you had 10 data points of the weight of cows on your farm: 1150, 1400, 1100, 1600, 1800, 1550, 1650, 1350, 1400, and 1300. Sorting them into ascending order: 1100, 1150, 1300, 1350, 1400, 1400, 1550, 1600, 1650, 1800 Divide them into bins: 1100, 1150| 1300, 1350, 1400, 1400| 1550, 1600, 1650| 1800 Count the frequencies: Bin 1: 2, Bin 2: 4, Bin 3: 3, Bin 4: 1 You can construct your histogram by hand using the data you’ve sorted, or you can use a program such as Excel or another statistics program. To draw by hand, simply draw out an x- and y- axis and set the scale on each one. The x-axis will be set by the bins you’ve already chosen and the scale of the y-axis is set by the frequency data. Draw bars for each bin that go up to the frequency value associated with the bin. Color them in and make sure all of the bars are touching each other.  For the weight of cows example, the x-axis will range from 1100- 1900 in increments of 200; the scale of the y-axis will range from 1 to 4 in increments of 1. The first bin, 1100-1300, has a frequency of 2, so draw a bar up to 2 and color it in. Directly next to the first bar, draw the second bar for the second bin which has a frequency of 4. The third bar goes up to 3 and the final bar goes up to 1. No graph is complete without labeled axes. Make them large and bold so they stand out. Make sure the labels accurately represent the data being presented. The y-axis will be labeled frequency, while the x-axis label will depend on the type of data collected. For the example, the x-axis will be labeled something like “Weight of Cows in Pounds” and the y-axis will be labeled “Frequency”.

"Usually, rainbows are seen in the rain. That is because there are many water droplets falling through the sky refracting the sun’s light. To mimic that, you should find a source of water that can be moved. A water hose or a spray bottle will work nicely. A stream of water is not ideal for creating a visible rainbow. Instead, you want a mist of water that the sun has to pass through. You can create this mist by holding your thumb over the end of a water hose, or turning a nozzle to the “mist” position.

",Locate a water source. Create a mist.
"If you decide to wax instead of shave, you are still at risk for getting ingrown hairs, especially in the bikini area. Always cleanse and exfoliate your skin before waxing. Reduce your risk of infection by using a new applicator stick for each application of wax. Depilatory creams work by dissolving the hair rather than cutting it or pulling it out of the skin. For this reason, they are less likely to lead to ingrown hairs. Chemical hair removers can cause rashes or irritation in some people. Test the product on a small area of your skin before use. Laser hair removal is a semi-permanent hair removal technique that involves destroying the hair and the root with a guided laser beam. While this technique does not usually completely eliminate hair in the treated area, it will reduce hair density significantly. This reduces the need for shaving, plucking, and other hair removal techniques that lead to ingrown hairs.  Laser hair removal is relatively safe, and the side effects (typically redness and irritation) are usually mild and temporary. In rare cases, permanent scarring may occur. Keep in mind that laser hair removal can be costly. Typically, multiple treatments are needed over the course of several months for the treatment to be effective.

Provide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:

",Use sanitary waxing practices. Try a chemical hair remover. Use laser hair removal.
"As a new mother, you will likely be overwhelmed with the care required for your new baby. In addition to taking care of your baby's needs, it's important that you also meet your own needs and get lots of rest. If you are feeling overly tired, ask your partner to watch the baby and take a quick 10-minute break so you can take a rest and relax. Stress and lack of sleep can contribute to a low immunity to infections and lead to the development of mastitis.  When sleeping at night, try to sleep on your back to avoid putting pressure on your breasts and do not wear a bra to bed. This can place pressure on sensitive milk ducts, which can cause them to become inflamed. If inflammation occurs, the milk ducts can become clogged, which can then lead to mastitis. If you like to sleep on your side, use a body pillow to help you get into a comfortable position that doesn't put pressure on your breasts. Go braless as often as possible to avoid added pressure on the milk ducts. Wear loose, comfortable clothing so you don't put pressure on your breasts.  If you do wear a nursing bra, it should be properly fitted to your body. You should be able to lean forward when putting on the bra so your entire breast falls in the bra cup. There should be no breast tissue punched at the edges of the cup or bra. You should avoid wearing other constricting clothing like tight bathing suits, breast pads, and placing heavy shoulder purses or diaper bags across your chest. It's very common for your nipples to crack while you're nursing, and cracked nipples provide an entryway for bacteria to get in and cause mastitis. Prevent cracked nipples by doing the following:  Let your nipples air dry after feedings. This is better for them than toweling them dry or washing them off each time, which can be drying. Rub your nipples with a lanolin cream. Look for a natural, alcohol-free cream that you can use to treat dry, sore nipples.

",Get at least eight hours of sleep. Avoid wearing tight-fitting tops or bras throughout the day. Take care of cracked nipples.
"For even baking, position the oven rack at the center of the oven and bake one sheet of cookies at a time. If baking two sheets, it is recommended that you space the racks so as to divide the oven into thirds, then rotate the cookie sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through baking. It will take several minutes for the oven to heat up, so save time by preheating it before you start mixing the cookie dough. Place a piece of parchment or wax paper on the cookie sheets and set them off to the side. Lining the cookie sheets with wax paper will prevent the cookies from sticking during baking.

"Instead of using store-bought, commercially-made flypaper, make your own using ingredients that aren’t poisonous.  Use any type of paper cut into 2” strips of any length.  Punch a hole in one end of the strip to put string through for hanging.  Combine ½ cup of corn syrup and ¼ cup of sugar to make a sticky mixture.  Apply the mixture to both sides of each paper strip.  Hang the strips near your dog’s food and water bowls (high enough so the dog cannot grab them).  Replace the strips when they have several dead flies on them. Pour apple cider vinegar into a bowl, cup, glass, etc.  Place plastic wrap over the top of the bowl, cup, glass, etc., and attach it using an elastic.  Make sure the plastic is pulled tight over the opening, like the surface of a drum.  Using a toothpick, stab a bunch of holes into the plastic wrap.  Place the whole contraption near your dog’s food and water bowls, but not in a location where the dog can get to it.  Empty and refill as often as needed. An alternative to apple cider vinegar is wine.  Wine can be used in the exact same fashion to attract and kill flies.  You can also add dish soap to the wine to help ensure the flies cannot escape.  Of course, you’d have to waste wine in order to do this, so your problem would probably have to be rather severe to use this method! Cut an individual-sized pop/soda/juice bottle in half, making the bottom half larger than the top half.  Fill half the bottom half with water and a put in a couple drops of dish soap.  Place the top half of the bottle into the bottom half, inverted (i.e. the opening of the bottle goes towards the water, without the cap on).  Spread honey or jam near the mouth of the bottle that’s facing the water.  Place the whole contraption near your dog’s food and water bowls - but still out of their reach (as it’ll probably attract dogs as well as flies!). A bug zapper is designed more for outdoor use than indoor use and requires an electrical outlet.  The zapper emits a light that attracts many insects and when they get close enough zaps them with an electrical discharge that kills them. Note that flies, in general, are not attracted to light and a bug zapper may not be as effective on them as other methods.

",Make your own flypaper strips. Trap fruit flies with apple cider vinegar. Trap flies with honey or jam. Buy and install a bug zapper.
"Adults are not as quick at learning new skills as children and they may find it difficult to remember letter sounds and words that a child would pick up easily. However, teaching an adult how to read is also an extremely rewarding experience. You will just need time and a considerable amount of patience.  Unlike children, adult learners cannot spend several hours in a classroom every day. If they are juggling work and family life, they will have a couple of hours a week at most to work on their reading. This can significantly prolong the learning process. Illiterate adults may also have a lifetime's worth of negative experiences and emotions that they associate with their inability to read, which can be difficult to overcome. In order to find out where to begin, you will need to assess your student's current reading ability. This may be a professional assessment or simply asking the learner to do whatever reading and writing he/she already knows, and taking note of where he/she struggles.  Continue observing your learner's level throughout the learning process. If he or she consistently struggles with a particular skill or concept, take it as a cue to help work on that skill. An illiterate adult's greatest challenge is overcoming insecurity about their ability to read. Many adults suffer from a lack of confidence and from the fear that it is too late for them to learn how to read. Express confidence in their learning abilities and reassure them that it is never too late to start.  Reassure them that their familiarity with spoken English and their pre-existing vocabulary will play a major role in learning how to read. Many adults have spent years hiding their inability to read from teachers, family and co-workers. Let them know that they no longer need to be ashamed or embarrassed and that you respect their courage in coming to you to learn to read. When teaching adults, look for materials that are not too childish, or at least ask whether they mind using children's materials. However, keep in mind that children's books can be easy beginning materials, as they use simple words and rhymes to reinforce the connection between letter patterns and sounds.  Also remember that if you use materials that are too difficult or outside of their comfort zone, adult readers can easily become discouraged. Using materials that are challenging, yet manageable will help to build the adult reader's ability and confidence. Try to use material that is interesting and relevant to your student. By using relevant materials, you are making the learning process less of a chore and are encouraging your adult student by showing them the practical applications of learning to read.  Try using road signs, newspaper articles or restaurant menus when practicing reading. Use technology by sending your student each new word they have to learn via text message. This makes learning fun and relevant to everyday life.

",Understand that teaching an adult how to read is a difficult undertaking. Assess their ability. Make them feel secure. Use appropriate materials. Make it relevant.
"This lightening formula calls for chamomile tea, lemon juice, cinnamon, honey and olive oil. Additionally, you’ll need a clean spray bottle that will hold 1.5 cups (12 fluid ounces) of the lightening spray. The exact measurements are:  1 chamomile tea bag; 1/2 cup lemon juice (freshly squeezed); 1 teaspoon cinnamon; 1 teaspoon honey; 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place the tea bag in a mug and pour the boiling water over it (just as you would if you were making yourself a cup of tea). Allow the tea bag to steep until the water has cooled to room temperature, which will take about 30 minutes. Remove the bag from the water and dispose of it once you’ve finished steeping. The tea liquid should fill your 12 ounce spray bottle about halfway up. Then measure out ½ cup lemon juice, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon olive oil and add those to the spray bottle.  1 teaspoon of coconut oil can be substituted for the olive oil, if you prefer.  Add ½ teaspoon of sea salt to the mixture to achieve textured, beachy waves. If you heat up the honey for a few seconds in the microwave, it will be thinner and easier to work with. Once all of the ingredients are in the bottle, attach the nozzle to the spray bottle to close it up. Shake the bottle well to combine the ingredients. Be sure to put the nozzle on tightly to avoid any messes. After spraying the formula on your hair, run a fine-toothed comb through it to make sure the lightening spray is evenly distributed. To achieve an ombre look, spray the mixture on the ends of your hair only. For a more dramatic ombre look, spray it on the bottom half of your hair. The spray will keep for 3-4 days as long as you keep it cold. You can use this mixture on your hair whenever you plan to be outside in the sun during those 3-4 days.

Provide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:

",Gather your ingredients. Boil 1 cup of water and pour it over the chamomile tea bag. Pour the tea and other ingredients into a clean spray bottle. Mix the ingredients together. Spray the mixture generously onto wet hair and expose it to sunlight. Store the leftover mixture in the refrigerator.
"The symbols at the beginning of the staff lines on a piece of sheet music show you how to play the song. Following the clef symbol to identify the treble or bass clef, you'll see the key signature and time signature.  The key signature indicates the key in which the song is played. If it's a key signature other than C major, it will contain sharps or flats somewhere. Those sharps or flats are noted at the beginning of the piece of music. The key signature means that every time you play that note throughout the piece, you'll play the sharp or flat indicated rather than the non-accidental note. For example, the G Major scale includes an F sharp, so for the G Major key signature you'd see a sharp sign (#) over the staff line that represents the F note. A major chord is the simplest type of chord you can play. It's a 3-note chord made up of the first, third, and fifth notes on the scale of the root note. Other chords involve making a change to the major chord.  You can start with a C major chord, since it's perhaps the easiest. Find the C key on your piano, then skip a white key and place another finger on the third key. Skip another white key and place a third finger on the fifth key. Play these 3 notes at the same time and you have a C Major chord. Applying the same theory, keep your hand in the same position but slide over one key to the D key on the piano. Notice where your fingers now fall. They should be positioned over the D, the F sharp, and the A. If you play these 3 notes together, you're playing a D Major chord. A minor chord is played the same as a major chord, except that instead of playing the middle note, or third note of the scale, you play the key to its immediate left, or one half-step lower. All minor chords are built the same way.  For example, for a C Major chord, you would play C, E, G, but for C minor you would play C, E-flat, G. You can follow this theory to form all the minor chords the same way you formed all the major chords. Seventh chords get their name from the fact that you're playing 4 notes in the chord, with the fourth note being the seventh note in the root note's scale.  For the major seventh chord, you simply play the first, third, fifth, and seventh notes of the major scale. For C Major Seventh, for example, notated as ""CM7"" or ""Cmaj7,"" you would play C-E-G-B. For any seventh chord that isn't a major seventh, you want to lower the seventh note a half-step. For example, C7 would be C-E-G-B flat. C minor 7, abbreviated ""Cm7,"" is a C-minor chord plus the lowered seventh note: C-E flat-G-B flat. A suspended chord has an unfinished sound, because you replace the third note of the major scale with the fourth note. To remember this, think of suspending your finger over the third note and dropping it further over on the fourth.  Ultimately, you're playing a regular major chord, except instead of playing the first, third, and fifth notes of the scale, you're playing the first, fourth, and fifth notes. Suspended chords may be represented on chord charts with the abbreviation ""sus"" (short for ""suspended"") or with the number 4 following the root note (to indicate you play the major chord with the fourth note instead of the third). Once you understand the theory behind the different chords and how they relate to the major chords, you can combine different variations to create more complex chords.  For example, you can create a suspended seventh chord by combining a suspended chord with a seventh chord. Play the fourth note of the major scale instead of the third, and then play the lowered seventh note. All 4 notes played together will be a suspended seventh chord. While these complex chords are used rarely in popular music, if you understand chord theory you'll have no problem playing them when you see them on chord charts or in sheet music.

Provide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:

",Find the key signature. Build a major chord. Build a minor chord. Apply chord theory to seventh chords. Move on to suspended chords. Use chord theory to make sense of more complex chords.
"Jobs on Wall St. are more sought after than ever, and the hiring process has become more rigorous as a result. It’s not uncommon for an interview with a Wall St. firm to last for an entire day, and the interview process entails far more than the interviewer asking you a few questions about your five year plan. You’ll most likely be tested (informally or formally) on a wide variety of subjects germane to the activities of the firm you’re interviewing with.  Since 98% of applicants don’t get hired, you need to make sure you know everything you can about how your firm’s sector of the industry operates. These all-day interviews are called “super days,” and you should think of them as more akin to a bar exam than a typical job interview. Unless you already live in New York City, your interviews with firms are going to require travel. You’ll save money and time if you schedule several interviews over a span of days rather than one at a time. You’ll also cut down on stress. Travelling is an inherently stressful experience, and the less travelling you have to do, the better off you’ll be. While it is possible to overdress for some job interviews, an interview at a Wall St. firm isn’t likely to be one of them. Gentlemen should wear a dark blue or gray suit, white shirt, and a conservative tie. Although ladies have a bit more freedom, they should pick something similarly formal and businesslike. Super days are a test of endurance as much as a test of knowledge. Employees at Wall St. firms often have to work long hours, and the employers use the interview as an opportunity to see how an applicant will hold up. Take the same kinds of steps you took before you took the SAT—get eight hours of sleep, eat a light breakfast, give yourself enough time to come to the interview alert and rested. Remember, if you’ve gotten to the interview stage, you’ve already made it farther than the vast majority of applicants. The firm you’re interviewing with already likes what they see. If they didn’t you wouldn’t be there. Just allow the qualities that landed you the interview to shine through during the interview.

Provide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:

",Know your stuff. Schedule several interviews at once. Dress well. Come to the interview rested. Be confident.
"Cotton socks are generally a good choice. Make sure that the socks are neither too tight nor too loose!  Wear high socks or low socks, to your taste. Short socks will give your legs more space to breathe, but high socks can be useful for wicking away sweat. Tight socks can constrict your legs and slow your blood circulation. On the other hand, socks that are too loose might distract you by sliding down your legs. As you move about the gym, use a soft, clean towel to wipe your sweat away. You don't want to leave your sweat on the seat of a machine! Most gyms provide clean towels for members to use during their workouts. Do not share a towel with anyone, or else you risk sharing germs! Clean up any sweat that you do leave on a machine. Use a small, clean towel to wipe down the seat, the bars, and any other part that your sweat has touched. Your sweat carries bacteria that could infect someone else if left to dry on the machine! Even your own sweat, when left to dry on fabric, can breed nasty bacteria and then infect you. Odor-making bacteria tend to grow better on polyester than on cotton – but you should wash all gym clothes regardless.

"The most commonly used classes of OTC pain medications include Acetaminophen (Tylenol), and a class of drugs called ""NSAIDs."" NSAIDs stand for ""nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,"" and include medications such as Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and Naproxen sodium (Aleve). Aspirin is also technically an NSAID, although it more frequently used in the prevention of heart attacks and strokes than it is in easing chronic pain.  OTC pain medications are generally safe to take in the short-term (meaning for less than 10 days at a time), as long as you adhere to the dosing instructions on the bottle and do not exceed them. It is generally okay to have 500–1000 mg of Acetaminophen (Tylenol) every four to six hours as needed. However, if you consume moderate to heavy alcohol, your usage needs to be less and you should either temporarily reduce your consumption of alcohol, or speak to your doctor about a dosage that is safe for you. It is generally okay to have 400–800 mg of Ibuprofen (such as Advil) every four to six hours as needed. Note that the dosage for OTC drugs is smaller in children, and specific instructions will be present on the bottle. If you need to use OTC meds for more than 10 days to manage your pain, it is always advisable to book an appointment with your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits of doing so. Your doctor can also diagnose any underlying conditions (the root cause of your pain) at this time, and possibly advise different treatment options that may be more useful for you (depending, of course, upon what specifically is causing your pain). The greatest risk associated with excessive Acetaminophen (Tylenol) use is the possibility of liver toxicity. NSAIDs such as Advil should not be taken without first consulting a doctor if you have problems with stomach ulcers, or are on a blood thinning medication such as Warfarin or Coumadin (as NSAIDs can increase your risk of bleeding).  Another risk of overusing OTC drugs is when people inadvertently overdose by continuing with the maximum dosage of Acetaminophen or NSAIDs while simultaneously taking an OTC ""cold or flu"" medication that happens to contain the same ingredients. If you take a cold or flu medication that already contains Acetaminophen or NSAIDs, you may inadvertently exceed the maximum recommended dose and put yourself at risk of potentially serious side effects. Tylenol can irritate the stomach and cause ulcers and gastritis.  This can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia.  Special care should be taken with those who drink alcohol. Always read the label of cold and flu medications carefully to see what ingredients are present in the mixture. If you need OTC drugs for more than 10 days, book an appointment with your physician to do a more detailed assessment of your pain, and to look into alternative modes of treatment that may be more effective (and also safer) for you moving forward. Also consult your doctor if you have other health concerns, such as ongoing heart disease, kidney disease, or liver disease, prior to using OTC medications for your pain.

"Tiaras made out of hard, study plastic work great. You can also use a metal one as well. Avoid tiaras made from cheap, flimsy, or brittle plastic, as they may not hold up well to the weight of the shells. Make sure that the tiara has combs at the end. This will help anchor the crown when you wear it. If the tiara has any clunky rhinestones or fuzzy boas, you will need to remove those first. If the tiara has any protruding pieces that you feel will interfere with your final design, cut them off with a craft blade; you can also try carefully breaking them off instead.  If you have a metal tiara, you can try cutting parts off with wire cutters. If you really like a certain embellishment, save it so that you can glue it on later. This will give the shells something to stick to. If your tiara has lots of curly designs, be sure to wrap the pipe cleaners around each individual design. You will end up with a tiara that looks like it's made out of pipe cleaners. Don't use the standard fuzzy pipe cleaners.  Use colors that match your shell colors. If you have lots of warm colors, use gold. If you have lots of cool colors, try silver, blue, or green. For a more natural looking crown, use jute cord instead. Secure both ends with hot glue.  Another option would be to use thin, satin ribbon. Choose a color that works with your design, and secure both ends with glue.

"The majority of your customers will search for you online, so it's essential to have a user-friendly website. At the very least, your website should include information about your business and your history in the moving industry, details about the quoting process, contact information, and a description of the services you offer. If possible, allow customers to schedule quotes online, view your availability, or read testimonials from other customers. One of the easiest ways to start your business is by helping people you already know with their moves. You can be on the lookout for any announcements related to moving that your friends make on social media. Once you have provided good service to friends, they are likely to recommend you to others. In order to spread the word about your business, have some professional looking promotional materials printed and distribute them around your community.  You can distribute business cards at public events, tuck them into local bulletin boards, or even print them in directories, yearbooks, and other local print media. Flyers can be mailed, posted in public places, or distributed to businesses that might be able to refer customers to like you, such as furniture stores. Make sure you have a professional, recognizable logo that is consistent across all of your marketing materials. Another way to get your business's name out there is to make yourself visible. Whether it's by working with partners at local events, volunteering, or using your vehicle for an ad campaign, visibility is key for driving business. Build relationships with influential people in your community. Realtors are a great source of referrals to movers, as are the owners of local furniture stores or the office staff at a large apartment complex. You can use directory sites like Craigslist to advertise your services to people in your local community for free. Social media is also a great way to spread the word about your business. There are many options for advertising, depending on your budget and your target market. Consider options like PPC advertising, television and radio commercials, newspaper ads, direct mail flyers, or memberships with referral services. The best thing you can do to grow your business is to provide excellent service to your customers. Be sure to always be on time, be friendly, be respectful of your customers' belongings, and offer accurate price quotes.  Be sure to ask your happy customers to post reviews about you online. New customers will see these reviews and will have more faith in you as a reputable company if they see that others have had a good experience. You will inevitably end up having to deal with an unhappy customer at some point, but do your best to resolve the problem to the customer's satisfaction. The last thing you want is negative reviews about your business circulating the internet!

"Going to class will help you learn the coursework. Plus, it gives you a chance to impress your teacher with your thoughts and questions. Go to school everyday so you can stay on top of your coursework. Be on time for class so your teacher sees that you're taking school seriously. Being prepared for class is super important because it ensures you have the tools for success. Additionally, it shows your teacher that you’re ready to learn, which helps you have a great reputation. Read your syllabus or talk to your teacher to make sure you have the items you need every day. For instance, always have a writing utensil, something to write on, and your text. If your school allows electronics, bring your laptop or tablet for note taking. You probably have a ton of stuff to do, so you might be tempted to skip the readings your teacher assigns. However, this can make it hard for you to learn the material. Always do your assigned readings before the day of class so you’re fully prepared to discuss the subject matter. Reading the text ahead of time also allows you to figure out what you don’t understand so you can ask questions in class. If you’re allowed to mark up your book, highlight important passages and make notes. If you can’t write in your book or have a digital book, write your notes in your notebook. Review your notes before class so that you have something to say during the class discussion.  As an example, you might write, “The weather seems to represent the main character’s mood,” or “The two generals could have won the battle if they’d worked together instead of against each other.” It’s also helpful to write down questions that you want to ask. For instance, you might plan to ask, “Is the star in this story a symbol? What does it symbolize?” You may feel embarrassed when you don’t understand something, but it’s normal to have questions. In fact, it shows everyone that you’re a good student who wants to learn! If you have a question, ask it during class or talk to your teacher after class.  It’s best to ask questions during class. You might even be helping your classmates who have the same question. If you’re too shy to ask, stay for a few minutes after class, talk to your teacher after school, or send your teacher an email. during class lectures or discussions. Class discussions and lectures have a lot of important information that will help you understand your coursework. Write down the topics your teacher highlights in class. Additionally, note the important details they focus on during the class discussion.  As an example, write down important names, dates, and concepts in history class.

"Of all the hand grenade throwing positions, the prone stance typically offers the least power, distance, and accuracy, so, when other throwing stances are possible, they're usually preferable. However, in situations where you're pinned behind very low cover, you may not want to risk exposing yourself to enemy fire by taking the time to rise to a kneeling position when you throw. In these cases, throwing from prone may be the only way to strike the enemy without putting yourself in mortal danger. To begin, lie on your back behind your cover. You should be lying parallel to the action with your throwing arm positioned away from your target. This allows you easily grip and arm the grenade against your chest and also gives you the best possible view of the conditions around you so that you can react as necessary. Bend your throwing leg at a 90o angle, keeping it in contact with your other knee. Brace the side of your boot against the ground. As in the kneeling stance, this will give you added stability and power while throwing. Simultaneously, arm the grenade by pulling the pin and depressing the lever. Cock your throwing arm next to your ear and get ready to throw. To throw the grenade, push off with your throwing foot and roll yourself toward your target as you launch the grenade across your body. Follow through with this motion. If needed, you can even roll all the way over. Keep your head and body low as you throw, however — the primary advantage of the prone stance is that it minimizes your exposure to enemy fire, so stay low to maintain this advantage. If you can, you may also want to use your non-throwing hand to grab any object in front of you for extra leverage. Since you're already lying in the prone position, you won't need to ""get low"" after you release the grenade. You should, however, make sure that you're behind any available cover. As mentioned above, if there's no cover available, you'll want to orient yourself in the direction of the blast to minimize the profile area that you expose to shrapnel. It bears mentioning that, even with proper form, you'll have a very difficult time getting the same sort of throwing distance from the prone position as you might from the kneeling and (especially) the standing position. Because the grenade is likely to be closer to you when it explodes, it's even more important to protect yourself after throwing.

",Lie on your back as you remove the pin. Cock your throwing leg back and ready the grenade to throw. Throw the grenade across your body with a rolling motion. Take cover.
"Use water and a facial cleanser to clear make up, dirt, and debris away from your brows. Make sure your brows are thoroughly dry before you begin. The pencil should be in line with the corner of your eye and the center of your nostril. Make sure to hold the pencil in a straight position. Observe where the tip of the pencil lands on your brow. This is where your eyebrow should start.  If you have wide set eyes, you will want to make this gap slightly narrower. If you have close set eyes, you will want to make the gap between the brows wider.  Your eyebrow size may need to be adjusted, depending on your unique facial features. A good rule of thumb is that the gap between your eyebrows should be about the length of your eye.

". Anytime you receive a new piercing--or move to a larger size gauge--it is important to refrain from touching the area for at least 24 hours. After this, you will need to clean the area several times a day. Before touching your piercings it is important to wash your hands with hot water and soap. Your fresh ear piercing may accumulate some dried skin or other crust. With clean hands, moisten a cotton swab with water and use it to carefully removed any dried matter from the front and back of each piercing. Once the dry matter has been removed, lather a drop of unscented antibacterial soap and water, and work this around each piercing (front and back). Rinse each piercing with cool water and dry them with a clean paper towel. Do this at least once, but not more than twice per day. In addition to cleansing with antibacterial soap, you may want to perform a salt water soak. In order to do this, moisten a clean cotton ball with saline solution, and press it up to your ear piercing.  You can do this for 10 minutes at a time, 2-3 times per day. Perform a salt water soak if your piercing feels swollen, irritated, or otherwise painful. Use this practice sparingly with bone, stone, or wooden jewelry. A piercing is essentially an open wound, and as such, is prone to infection. You can prevent infections in your ear piercings by avoiding risky activities. For at least 3 weeks after getting a new piercing (or sizing up your gauges), avoid:  Removing or changing jewelry Saunas, swimming pools, lakes, and other bodies of water Wearing hats or dirty clothes Touching the piercing unnecessarily Touching the piercing with dirty hands

"Collapsing trachea treatment is either medical (non-surgical) or surgical. Generally, medical management involves weight management and using various medications to treat the airway and other related conditions. Medical management works in most dogs with a collapsing trachea; however, since a collapsing trachea usually worsens over time, surgical treatment may eventually be needed.  It is best to start with medical management, then consider surgery if the condition worsens.  Your veterinarian will go through each of the medications with you and indicate which ones will likely work best for your Chihuahua. Collapsing tracheas can range in severity. If your Chihuahua’s tracheal collapse is severe (trachea is 75‒100% collapsed), your veterinarian will probably want to hospitalize him and give him intensive care. Intensive care includes extra oxygen and heavy sedation. The sedation will calm your Chihuahua and keep him from fighting against his breathing troubles and other treatments. The length of hospitalization will depend on how long it takes your veterinarian to stabilize your Chihuahua and get him well enough for home care. If your Chihuahua’s tracheal collapse is mild to moderate, you can treat him at home. Treating his airways has several goals: reducing inflammation and bronchial spasms, relaxing the airways, suppressing coughing, and eliminating excessive secretions. Your veterinarian will prescribe the medications, describe how they work, and explain how to administer them.  The strain of coughing could damage the sensitive lining of your Chihuahua’s airways. Anti-inflammatory medications will reduce the damage and inflammation. The bronchi are the two main branches of the trachea that bring air into the lungs. Bronchial spasms cause the bronchi to become narrow.  Medications to relax the airways and relieve the spasms are called bronchodilators. They open up the bronchial airways and relax the lung muscles.  If your veterinarian found a respiratory infection, he or she will prescribe antibiotics.  The medications may take a few days to start working. Once they start working, you will start to see definite improvement in your Chihuahua’s breathing. Small dogs with a collapsing trachea often have heart disease as well. Other conditions that may be present are swollen lymph nodes around the trachea, dental disease, and liver disease. Treating the other conditions and tracheal collapse at the same time may improve your Chihuahua’s overall treatment outcome and prognosis. Since activity can worsen a collapsing trachea, you will need to limit your Chihuahua’s activity until his condition is more stable. For example, shorten his walks and walk him more slowly. Rather than playing an active game with him, consider spending quality quiet time with him. Your veterinarian will let you know when you can start increasing his activity level (if at all). Your Chihuahua may feel anxious about not being able to breathe very well. To relieve this anxiety, your veterinarian may prescribe an anti-anxiety medication. The less anxious your Chihuahua feels, the easier it will be to keep him calm during treatment. Overweight dogs are prone to collapsing tracheas. If your Chihuahua is overweight, help him lose weight by switching him to a weight loss diet (available commercially or at your veterinarian’s office), minimizing his treats, and eliminating table scraps from his diet. Ask your veterinarian what your Chihuahua’s ideal weight should be, and how long it should take to get him down to that ideal weight.

"The lemonade cleanse, also known as the ""master cleanse"", is one of the most popular and well-known cleanses, thanks to several celebrity advocates. The lemonade cleanse involves making a drink out of water, lemon juice, maple syrup and cayenne pepper which you will consume exclusively for a period of between three and ten days. The lemonade cleanse is intended to help you flush toxins from your system, while also effectively aiding weight loss.  To make one glass of cleansing lemonade, mix 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of freshly squeezed lemon juice, half a teaspoon (1 g) of cayenne pepper and .5 teaspoons (2.5 mL) of organic maple syrup into a 10 fluid ounces (300 mL) glass of water. Make four to five times this quantity to make enough to last you an entire day.  Be aware that most medical experts do not recommend this cleanse as it creates a serious calorie and nutrient deficit that can have a negative impact on health. It is also not scientifically proven to effectively flush out toxins. This cleanse is a less intense version of the lemonade cleanse, as it only needs to be completed one day a week and may be accompanied by some light, healthy snacks. In addition to the apple and ginger, this recipe also includes psyllium husk - a type of dietary fiber which is said to effectively bind waste material together, making it easier for the waste to be flushed from the system.  To make the juice cleanse, combine eight ounces of freshly-pressed or organic apple juice with one teaspoon each of ground ginger and ground psyllium husk. Mix well with a spoon, or blend at a low speed.  Once again, this cleanse has not be scientifically proven to effectively remove toxins. to trigger a bowel movement. Doing a salt water flush is another popular, if rather unpleasant, way to cleanse your system of built-up waste and toxins. Salt is a natural disinfectant which effectively flushes out the entire intestinal tract. In fact, this process is so effective that it is often used as a cost-effective alternative to expensive colonic irrigation procedures. The flush involves drinking a glass of salty water on an empty stomach, then waiting an hour or two as the solution flushes out your bowels, resulting in multiple eliminations.  To make the salt solution, dissolve 3 teaspoons of unrefined, non-iodized sea salt into one quart of lukewarm, purified water. Drink the solution first thing in the morning, as quickly as possible, using a straw if it helps. You should then lie on your right side for half an hour. This aids the passage of the salt water into the small intestine. At this point, you will feel the urge to eliminate, so make sure you are near a bathroom! Be aware that intense diarrhea and sometimes vomiting are not uncommon after a salt water flush. These symptoms are normal and should subside within an hour or two. The salt water flush is not recommended for people with digestive or kidney problems, people with edema, or pregnant or nursing women. If you have any concerns about doing it, you should consult your physician first. Drinking this smoothie is a great natural, healthy way to cleanse your body, without resorting to depriving yourself of essential nutrients or going hungry. All you need to do is replace one meal a day with this energy-boosting drink, to gain all of its digestion-friendly benefits.

"If you are unable to relieve your laryngitis with the above mentioned home remedies, then make an appointment with your family doctor. A severe sore throat, swollen mucus membranes that are streaked with white pus, fever and malaise are all signs of an infection. However, only bacterial infections are impacted by antibiotics, so your doctor will likely swab your throat and determine if the infection is bacterial, viral or fungal.  If bacteria is the culprit (strep throat is a relatively common cause of laryngitis), then your doctor may prescribe a two week course of antibiotics, such as Amoxicillin or Erythromycin. Follow the doctor's instructions carefully when taking antibiotics. In particular, be sure you take the full course of antibiotics, even if you feel better. This ensures you completely eradicate the low levels of bacteria that will remain once you are feeling better; this bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics and become extremely difficult to treat later on. If you've had laryngitis for more than a few weeks and are a smoker, your doctor will likely refer you to an ENT (ear, nose, and throat doctor), who may use a laryngoscopy — a small tube with a tiny camera to get a better look at the back of your throat . If you have severe laryngitis that's not caused by bacteria and not helped by home remedies, then ask your doctor about the pros and cons of a short course of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, prednisolone or dexamethasone. Steroid medications are powerful and fast-acting anti-inflammatories that can reduce the swelling, pain and other symptoms in your throat. However, due to significant downsides, they are usually not recommended except as emergency treatments for people who must use their voices professionally.  The downside of steroidal medications is that they tend to reduce immune system function, weaken tissues and cause water retention, which is why they are typically prescribed for short periods of time only. Corticosteroid medication comes in pills, injectables, inhalers and oral sprays, which are especially effective for quickly combating a bout of laryngitis. As noted above, laryngitis is caused by a variety of diseases that affect the throat. For example, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) often triggers laryngitis because the stomach acid that flows up the esophagus irritates and inflames the throat and larynx. Thus, treating GERD with antacid and proton-pump medications will eventually clear up the laryngitis also. Similar approaches should be used for other conditions that trigger laryngitis, such as an enlarged thyroid gland, allergies, chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, benign vocal cord growths and throat cancer.  Chronic laryngitis (hoarseness) from long-term smoking can clear up on its own after quitting, although it may take many months or even a few years for the vocal cords to become healthy again. If your child's laryngitis is caused by ""croup,"" then see your doctor immediately for the appropriate medications. Croup narrows airway passages, causes difficulty breathing and leads to a barking-like cough. It can be life-threatening in rare circumstances.

"Depending on your budget and how many keepsakes you will need to purchase, there are many great ideas that can be customized to commemorate the founding of your company.  Branded apparel, a desk clock engraved with the company name and anniversary year, or a mug with your company logo might make great keepsakes to show your employees or stakeholders that they are appreciated. If you have a large budget and a production department in your company, you could even make a company history book or a short documentary to distribute to your employees. One way to give back to a community for a successful year of business is to give a donation, spend time in volunteer work, or make improvements to a local public space.  Consider giving your employees an optional day of volunteer service in the community to do a group project. You can work with groups like your local food bank, Habitat for Humanity, or your local parks service for day-long projects. Perhaps you would like to create some type of monument for your corporation that will stand the test of time.  A park bench, new playground equipment, or even trees planted along a freeway can be erected with a plaque specifying that it was donated on behalf of your company's anniversary. A time capsule is a great way to make a ceremony feel special and gives you something to look forward to in future years. It is also a great way to get employees involved in the ceremony.  You might put in items that represent each year of the company's history, each department in the company, or each employee (for a smaller company). Hold a company-wide ceremony to put items into the capsule and reminisce about the founding of the company and its vision going forward.

"You might think that working out every day will lead to bigger biceps, but your muscles actually get stronger during the resting period in between workouts, when they have time to recover. Over time they get larger in order to be capable of lifting more and more weight.  Train your biceps no more than twice a week for the best results. Work out other parts of your body on the days you aren't doing exercises to enhance your biceps. Training for too long during any given session can strain your biceps and cause an injury, setting back your progress. Fifteen to thirty minute training sessions are sufficient for building strength and preventing injury when you are focusing specifically on your biceps. After a few months of biceps training, building muscle memory and strengthening the biceps, you can safely go all in. Make each training session count by working out as hard as you can during that short period of time. Lift the heaviest weights you can lift for six or more reps to make your sessions as high-intensity as possible. Bodybuilders call this method ""training to failure,"" because you should be training with weights heavy enough that you eventually can't complete another rep.  Find your ""train to failure"" weight by choosing a weight you can curl no more than 6 - 8 times before experiencing too much muscle fatigue to keep lifting. If you're able to complete several sets without breaking a sweat or ""failing,"" you need to increase the weight. If you can't lift it even one or two times without stopping, decrease the weight. Your train to failure weight will gradually increase as you gain muscle strength. Add weight in one to two pound increments every week or so, using the same standard to determine whether you're lifting too much weight or too little. Your train to failure weight should also be a weight you can lift while using the proper form. Using the right form keeps your biceps from getting injured and promotes the right kind of muscle-building.  Don't use momentum to lift the weights; use controlled movements. Lower them slowly rather than letting them drop quickly. If you find that you can't complete more than a few reps without losing your good form, you're lifting too much weight. Start with a lighter weight and build up your strength. Take one to two minute breaks between sets to let your muscles rest.

","Don't train every day. Limit the length of your sessions. When you do train, go all in. Use the right form."

"Adding potted plants around your above ground pool can help it blend in with the rest of your backyard. If you install a deck, position a few potted plants around the sides or around the bottom of the pool. You can also grow trees or shrubs around the above ground pool as a long-term alternative. Tiki torches are a popular way to give your above ground pool an outdoorsy touch.  Stake the tiki torches in the ground surrounding the pool at an even distance from each other, positioning them upright to prevent them from tilting.  You can buy tiki torches online, from a garden center, or at many home improvement stores. String lights around the tiki torches for cheap and stylish lighting while swimming at night. Straw bales can make a cheap, natural siding for above ground pools. Stack the straw bales around the sides to approximately halfway up the above ground pool's height to use as a decoration and partial step into the pool.

"You should plan accordingly when the weather is either very cold or very hot. Dress your kids for their activities – this means a coat or snowsuit, mittens, scarf, hat, and boots for snow play, layered clothing for intermediate temperatures, and light clothing when it's hot.  The key to dressing for cold weather is layering. Active kids will get hot outdoors, even when it’s cold. The problem is that they will sweat, and this dampness can be uncomfortable and actually make them lose body heat more quickly – this is a risk for hypothermia. Dress them in layers so that, for example, they can remove their heavy coat if they overheat.  Try three layers: an inner level that keeps dabs moisture and keeps it away from most of the body (polyester and modern materials are good; cotton is not). A middle layer is for insulation. This can consist of wool or fleece and even be in several layers. Finally, an outer layer is for the usual wind, water, and ice clothing – coat with hood, hat, snow pants, etc. A child who is too hot or too cold will show signs to look for. If you recognize any of these signs, take steps to get him inside to either cool down or warm up. If your child's symptoms do not go away within a few minutes, then call your child's doctor. Call 911 or emergency services if symptoms are severe.  Exposure to excessive heat can lead to muscle cramps, for example, and also fainting. These may be signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Dizziness, weakness, nausea, or lack of coordination are indications that something is seriously wrong. Dark colored urine is a sign that the child is dehydrated.   Children who are too cold may or may not say anything. Believe a child if she says she is too cold. Shivering, for example, though minor, is the first symptom of hypothermia. More serious signs include dizziness, hunger, nausea, fatigue, rapid breathing, and lack of coordination. One of the best things you can do to avoid heat-related illnesses in children is to make sure that they drink enough fluids. As said above, proper clothing will control over-heating, which will in turn lessen sweating and loss of fluids. Make sure you wear clothing appropriate to the environment. Clothes that are too thick or too warm can quickly cause a person to become overheated.  Children sweat less and have less evaporative cooling than adults. Let them exercise at their preferred level; do not urge them to exercise harder or play a strenuous sport in hot conditions. Don’t rely on your children telling you that they are thirst as a guide to their hydration. Thirst is actually a poor indicator. Have water and other beverages available to kids in hot and cold weather. In times of high fluid loss or significant sweating, be sure to replace your child's electrolytes as well by giving your child a sports drink or an oral electrolyte solution like Pedialyte. Avoiding the sun is not just about keeping kids cool. It is also about keeping their skin safe from harmful UV rays and avoiding sunburn, which can be particularly bad for young children.  Have your kids apply sunscreen all year round, even in winter, as one way to protect them from the sun. Use a screen with an SPF of at least 30. Avoid the strongest rays of the day – these occur at the same times of peak temperatures, between 10 am and 3 pm. Also, utilize shade strategically, either natural shade of trees of with an umbrella.

"You’ll need to be able to pour the concrete fairly quickly, and wheel barrowing the concrete the length of a substantial driveway is labor-intensive. If you cannot get the concrete trucks in a position to pour their payload directly into your forms, consider hiring a concrete pumping contractor to place the material for you.  You can also rent a piece of equipment with a front bucket, such as a skid steer, tractor, or a mechanical-engine powered wheelbarrow to make the job easier. For smaller driveways, a wheelbarrow will likely suffice. the slab as desired. You will want to get the surface as flat (note, this does not mean level) as possible to avoid bird baths, or standing water, on it. The driveway may slope, but should still be flat.  Not all driveways are level, but the surface should be fairly flat. You can use a hand trowel to make the surface evenly flat. Concrete will contract as it dries, which can result in cracking. Avoid this by using wood or plastic “zip strips” to add 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep “cracks” or cuts in the concrete every 4 feet (1.2 m) or so.  If you let the concrete dry too much, you may need to use a specialized saw to cut contraction joints in, so it’s best to do it early. Make sure you seperate the contraction joints by the same distance to keep the driveway looking uniform. Perfectly smooth concrete may make it difficult for your vehicle to get traction, especially in wet conditions. Drag a broom or a burlap sack along the concrete as its drying to create a textured surface your tires can grip.  This step must be done while the concrete is still damp enough to accept the texture. Broom the concrete in the direction you want your driveway to drain if there is a slope. . This is done by creating a moisture retaining barrier on the concrete's surface, either with a layer of plastic sheeting or by applying a chemical curing compound to prevent the concrete from drying out too quickly.  You should protect your concrete drive from extreme weather conditions for at least 3-7 days. Do not park your vehicle on the driveway until it has cured. The first time you park your vehicle on the driveway, lookout for signs of cracking or crumbling. If some cracks do appear, you may be able to repair them. You can then remove the wooden framing you built for the pour.  Be sure the concrete is completely cured before parking a vehicle on it, otherwise you may damage the concrete. To be safe, wait a minimum of three days for the concrete to cure.

"Try picking an activity that requires you to work together, or which will create special memories. The closer you and your sibling feel to each other, the less likely you’ll be to annoy each other. Commit to spending time together regularly, too, so it will become a habit.  Some activities that call for teamwork include doing a puzzle, building a model, or cooking dinner for your parents. By working together, you’ll learn to cooperate with one another, and you’ll be spending your energy on something positive instead of arguing. If you and your sibling both enjoy a similar hobby or activity, try to find a way to make it special. For example, if you both like to ride bikes, take them for a ride on your favorite trail. If you like the same types of movies, plan a marathon of your favorites for just the two of you. If your sibling is bothering you because they want attention, playing a more active role in their life may help. Take an interest in what your sibling is doing at school, as well as anything that’s important to them, like their hobbies and their friends. Make sure they know they can talk to you if something’s bothering you, too.  For instance, if you notice your sibling seems really down, you might pull them aside and say something like, “Did you have a hard day at school? You can talk to me about whatever’s going on.” If your sibling discloses that they’re in danger in some way, like they’re afraid of a bully at school, encourage them to talk to your parents or another trusted adult. You can even offer to sit with them during the conversation so they’ll feel more comfortable. Relationships are a two-way street, so if you want to be closer to your sibling, you’ll need to be willing to be open with them, too. Share as many details about your friends, hobbies, and favorite activities as you’re comfortable with, and let your sibling know that they can ask questions if they want. For instance, you might tell your sibling that you have a crush on someone at school, even if you don’t want anyone else to know.

"If you don't have a barre, you can use the wall -- or even a banister! Just have something you can return to for balance. For the record, that means your right foot is brought to your left knee, right knee facing outward -- that's the passé part. Relevé is where you are up on your toes. We'll be working with your right being your working leg, obviously. In this position, hold the bar with your left hand. Keep your core tight, pulling up your ribcage and keeping your hips down. Your right arm should be in the first position. Your arm stays in first position and your hips stay down. Plié is to bend your left leg slightly at the knee, making sure to keep your knees over your toes. To developé to the front, point your right toe stretched out in front of you at a 90-degree angle. Your arm opens to the second position as well. You remain in plié, knees over your toes. Make sure to keep your hips down! Your arm goes back to the first position, your leg resumes passé, and you go back to relevé. Remember: core tight and hips down at all times!

"Kohl’s Cash isn't actually cash, but it isn't as restricted as many coupons are, either. This means that you can typically use it in combination with sales, coupons, and other discounts that are available. Reap the savings!  However, certain brands or items may be excluded for various reasons. Check with Kohl’s customer service if you ever have a question about what the final price of an item will be. Kohl’s Cash will be applied first to your order, before any other discounts. For instance, imagine you are shopping during a promotion to get 10% off your total purchase. If your initial total is $70 and you have $10 in Kohl’s Cash, your final total will be $54 ($70-$10 = $60; 10% x $60 = $6; $60-$6 = $54). You are allowed to return purchases made using Kohl’s Cash. You will be refunded the cost you paid for the returned item (that is, the store price minus any discounts you received), and given a new Kohl’s Cash certificate that must be used within 30 days.  You can also return purchases you made that earned Kohl’s Cash. However, your Kohl’s Cash balance will be reduced by a corresponding amount. If you return an item you purchased that earned Kohl’s Cash, and you have already used the Kohl’s Cash, then the refund you receive for the returned item will be reduced by the amount of Kohl’s Cash that you earned and used. For instance, imagine you bought a coffee maker for $65, and you earned $10 in Kohl's Cash. You use that Kohl's Cash on a future purchase of a $32 shirt to bring its cost down to $22. If you decide to return the coffee maker, you will only receive $55 (the original price minus the $10 in Kohl's Cash you already used on the shirt). Kohl’s Cash that you receive as a certificate or electronically will have a stated expiration date. If you don't use the rewards by that date, unfortunately the Kohl’s Cash will no longer be valid.

"Skipping sleep can aggravate any issue you might be facing. Adults need 7-8 hours of sleep a night, with as few interruptions as possible. Sleeping too much can cause lethargy and depression, while sleeping too little can damage your immune resistance, your weight, and your mental health.  If you are having trouble sleeping at night, try to build a relaxing bedtime routine. Give yourself an hour before bed to brush your teeth, change into soft pajamas, and do one restful activity, such as reading, meditating, watching a show, or listening to music. Cut down on alcohol and caffeine, and try not to nap. When a work-related or stressful thought comes to you at night, say gently to yourself ""It's not time to think about that. It's my bedtime."" Regular exercise can make you more energetic, confident, healthy, and relaxed. Most adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week. Break your exercise up into shorter increments across the week. If you don't like the gym, try going on brisk walks, taking bike rides, or attending dance or yoga classes. Cooking at home is cheaper and healthier than eating out, so teach yourself to cook the things you love, and keep a well-stocked fridge. Rather than bothering with vitamins and supplements, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and vary your diet. Eating a wide range of foods will help you get the nutrients your body needs. Make sure to get the protein and carbohydrates you need for energy. Eat at least three meals a day with healthy snacks in between. Treat yourself the way any human deserves to be treated: with compassion, respect, and love. Instead of being down on yourself, speak to yourself with calm attention. When negative thoughts and feelings come to you, name them. Identify the situations that bring those feelings on. Accept the feelings as they come, but analyze the beliefs behind them. If you have a negative feeling that comes often, name it and treat it like an annoying by-product of your environment. Say ""oh, there's body-shame again. Probably because I'm in this waiting room surrounded by magazines depicting one body type."" Mindfulness means paying attention to your thoughts, senses, and feelings in the moment, without interpretation or judgment. It can relieve your anxiety, and help you relax out of a negative spiral. To practice mindfulness, pay attention to your senses. List everything you can see, smell, hear, and feel in the moment.  Try saying what you are doing when you begin to feel tense or stressed. Say ""I am walking up the street. I am holding my jacket closed. I am breathing."" Feel the breath coming in and out of you. Notice which parts of your body rise and fall. When your mind wanders, remind yourself to pay attention to your breath.   To relax your whole body, tense and relax each muscle in turn. Know what you are earning and spending. Make sure you have enough to pay for your monthly expenses and put aside for the future. If you are spending more than you earn, see if you can reduce your expenses. Having a budget will reduce your anxiety and help you make better decisions.  Calculate what you make each month, what you are spending, and what you are spending it on. Then calculate what you can afford to spend each month. If you don't have a savings account, open one. Calculate an amount you can afford to deposit in it every month. Ways to start saving money include cooking at home, buying ingredients from scratch instead of buying processed food, taking public transportation, and not buying drinks from bars or coffee shops. One realistic way to help yourself is to recognize the value of an outside opinion. There are some situations we can't get out of on our own. If you are struggling with an addiction, mental illness, money trouble, legal trouble, or abuse, you might have trouble recovering without the knowledge and skillset of a professional.

"Expect shucking corn to get a little messy. At the very least, have a bag handy to throw away the husk’s leaves and silken strands as you work. To make life even easier, line a trashcan or similar container with a bag so you can work over that, or even inside of it. Alternatively, you can also line your kitchen counter with paper or other compostable material if you want to compost the leaves and silk. This way you can easily ball up the whole bundle when you’re done. Give the husk a quick look-over and find whichever leaf seems to be the outermost. Strip that off and continue peeling away the outer leaves as you work your way inward. Stop once the ear seems to be covered by only one layer of remaining leaves. The last layer should be a little translucent, so once you can see the kernels through the leaves, you should be there. Pull the tops of the remaining leaves away from the ear’s top. Stop peeling once you’ve exposed three or four rows of kernels. However, as you peel the leaves back, remember: The aim is to rip off all the leaves at once, in one move. So don’t peel the tops away from the ear in a way that would make it difficult to hold them all in one hand. The “tassel” is the bunched-up ends of all the silken strands inside. Gather this as well as the tops of the inner leaves in your dominant hand. Use your other hand to clutch the ear by its bottom. If you’re unable to grab them all in one hand, don’t worry. As long as you have most of the leaves and tassel in hand, the other leaf or leaves may still come off with them. Hold the ear vertically with its tip at the top. Then, with the leaves’ tops and the silk tassel in one hand, give them a hard yank down the length of the ear to where your other hand is. This should strip the whole ear, but if you weren’t able to get all the leaves’ tops in one hand, just repeat with any leaf that didn’t come off with the others. Your corn should now resemble a rocketship, with the ear as the rocket pointing in one direction, and the leaves and silk as its flames pointing the opposite way. Reorient your grip on the ear so you’re holding it by its exposed kernels. Gather the stripped leaves and silk in your dominant hand. Give them another hard yank, along with a twisting motion to easily rip them free of the ear’s bottom. Or, if you find it easier to rip the leaves off one by one, go ahead and do that. Expect most of the silk to have been stripped away with their tassel. At the same time, don’t count on this to remove all of them. Inspect the ear for any stragglers and peel them off one by one.

"A common problem with many conclusions is that they simply restate the thesis and summarize what’s already been said. This doesn’t give your readers a compelling reason to read the conclusion -- they already know what it’s going to say. Instead, try to take your reader to the “next level” in your conclusion, or provide some further sophistication to your original ideas. There is usually no need to clog up the ending of your essay with quotes and analysis — that should have been what you were doing in your main paragraphs. The conclusion is the place where you tie everything together for your readers, not where you introduce new information. Don't use too many high-flying, two-dollar words in your conclusion. You want it to be readable and relatable, not rigid and boring. It’s much better to have clear, concise language than a meandering sentence stuffed with overlong words. Also, don't use ""Firstly,"" ""Secondly,"" ""Thirdly,"" etc. to make/finish your points. Make it clear what you're saying and how many points you're making. Now is not the time to introduce new ideas or content. That takes the focus off your original argument and could confuse readers. Don’t jumble things up — relay simply where your essay has led and state what you have come to think after conducting the necessary analysis. The conclusion is not the time to nitpick with a small theme in your essay. In fact, it's the time to step back and focus on the big picture. Make sure your essay focuses on the heart of the essay, not one strand of hair. These words are not advanced ways to start a transition.

"In English, you use the same word to talk about a school year or a 12-month period of time. Spanish has a different word, although in practice the two are used interchangeably.  Curso is a masculine noun. It is primarily used to refer to an academic year, but it also can be used as a translation of the English word ""course."" For example, you might say ""El curso acaba en junio,"" or ""The school year ends in June."" The Spanish word generación (hen-er-rahs-ee-OHN) is similar to the English word generation, but sometimes can be used in contexts where you would use the word year in English.  Typically generación is used to mean year in an academic setting. It refers to a specific year of students, such as the class of 2017. This group is a ""generation"" in the sense that you're talking about everyone in that graduating class. For example, you might say ""El príncipe William y yo estuvimos en la misma generación en el Colegio Eton"" if you wanted to tell someone ""Prince William and I were in the same year at Eton College."" If you're a wine enthusiast, you probably hear people talking in English about good years and bad years. In Spanish, rather than using año, you'll more frequently hear these words.   Cosecha (coh-SAY-chuh) refers to a harvest generally, but can be used when talking about wine. Vendimia (vin-dim-EE-uh) refers more specifically to a harvest of grapes, so it's a more specific term. For example, you might say ""1994 fue una buena vendimia"" or ""1994 fue una buena cosecha"" to mean ""1994 was a good year [for wine].""

"Wishing others would change or attempting to change others will cause you stress. It can easily make it difficult to remain peaceful in a relationship. Instead of attempting to change or control others, accept and love them (including their faults) for a more peaceful relationship.  Try writing a list of what you appreciate or are grateful for with the individuals in your life. Remind yourself that everyone has flaws. No one is perfect. . Holding in your thoughts and feelings in a relationship will not help you be peaceful. Part of being peaceful is being at peace with yourself. Honesty is a vital component to being at peace with yourself. So, be honest, but kind, when communicating what you really think and feel.  Having an open and honest dialogue in your relationships with others helps the relationship be more peaceful as well. It sets up a tone which communicates that if there are problems, they can be discussed and brought out into the open. You can state, “I want to you to be comfortable talking to me about anything.” Make sure you are communicating any frustrations or negative feelings in order to address them as quickly as possible. Try saying, “Our relationship is important to me. I don't want to bottle anything up and risk having it affect our relationship.” Have conversations just to check-in with loved ones. It will illustrate that you are interested in your loved ones well-being, and will make them more comfortable talking with you. You can begin with a simple, “How are you really doing?” What you say to convey peacefulness is important, but equally important is how you say it. The way you communicate with others is complex and conveys a great deal about your emotions and state of mind. Being peaceful in relationships with others includes speaking in a peaceful way.   Speak slowly and thoughtfully. Notice the volume of your voice. If you are loud, try quieting your voice. Try to use a softer tone when you speak instead of a more stressful or sharp tone. Pay attention to the words that you use. Consider what they are conveying about your outlook. As you are trying to accept others for who they are, you may come across some who make that difficult. People who are consistently negative can only interrupt your sense of peace. It may be best to let them go or remove them from your life. If you feel like you cannot let go of people completely, limit the contact you have with them.  While you want to be accepting of people and their imperfections, this doesn't mean you have to accept everything another person does. You are allowed to set boundaries as to what you will and will not accept in your life. For instance, you can't stop a boyfriend from doing drugs, but you can set a boundary that if he does them around you, you are leaving the relationship. Separate yourself from violent or aggressive people. A peaceful person does not engage in violence against herself or others.  Distance yourself from people who are overly judgmental or critical of the way you choose to live your life. Let go of anyone you feel disturbs your peacefulness. Parenting peacefully can be difficult. It is hard not to get caught up in the stress now and then. Start small, by changing one thing you do into something more peaceful. Once you feel you have accomplished that, begin a new one. Also try to notice the part you play and how you can help create the change you are looking for.  Try to remove or avoid critical or blaming statements. Instead of focusing on what your child may have done wrong, focus on what he did well or praise him for trying.

"The only way to accurately sight-in a rifle scope is to shoot it from a variety of positions. The easiest way to do this is at the gun range, typically, where you can be sure of the distances and your backstops. As always, practice good gun safety while you're handling a firearm and bring eye protection and ear protection, as well as enough ammunition for a day of shooting.  Use a bulls-eye target specifically for zeroing. These will typically have lots of measurements that will let you make accurate adjustments on the rifle. The more sure how ""off"" each hit is, the more accurately you'll be able to sight it in. Follow the specific regulations and rules at the range at which you're shooting. When you're zeroing a rifle, you need to eliminate user-error from the equation as much as possible. In other words, you can't miss. To give yourself the most accurate zero, you need to mount your gun into a rest specifically for this purpose, which are available at all sporting goods outlets, and may be available at a gun club near you, which you can borrow. All the more reason to head to the range. If you don't have a solid gun rest, get in as solid a position for shooting as possible. Even just setting up a couple of steady books, or your boots, or your jacket, will help you to rest the gun on something and shoot more accurately. Just make sure whatever you're resting it on is clear of the bolt. Wait for the signal that the range is hot, and look through your scope, training the sight on the bulls-eye. Using a proper stock to cheek weld and maintain the same sight picture as you usually do. Take the safety off the rifle. At the end of your exhale, hold for a split-second, then squeeze the trigger firmly without jerking it for the most accurate shot. Repeat 3-5 times for the most accurate first run. Wait for the signal that the range is cold, then safety and unload your rifle, checking it twice to be sure. Retrieve your target, or examine it through a range sight to get an accurate picture of your shots. The adjustments you Return to your rifle, and make adjustments using the adjustment knobs on the top and one side of the scope. Each scope will have a slightly different mechanism for making adjustments, but the principles are basically the same. For specific instructions about adjusting the zero, read the next section.  Once you've made your adjustments, repeat this process. Fire a few more rounds, check the grouping, and readjust. That's the process. It's a good idea to mark the holes in the target that you've already made, so you don't get confused later, or to use a new target. Some targets come with four or five different bullseye, just for this process. Generally speaking, most marksmen will want to sight-in the rifle from a variety of different positions, focusing most on the distances at which you'll be likely to fire. The same basic process and adjustments can be made at each position, but you'll probably want to measure from at least two, and probably more like three or four distances. Start at 20 yards (18.3 m), then move out to about 75. Try not to move more than 50 yards (45.7 m) at a time, to keep yourself making little adjustments. If you have time and feel like you could still make more adjustments, you can move into the 200–300 yard (180–270 m) range and get ambitious. At that point, however, wind will be a big factor.

","Head to the range. Mount the gun in a rest. Load the gun and take three to five shots with the rifle. Examine your shot grouping. Make adjustments using the knobs, and recheck. Set zero from multiple distances."
"Despite constant run-ins with people at work or home, you may be doubtful that you actually have an ego problem. There are many complex routes one can use to describe the ego. Perhaps the best descriptions is the approval-seeking part of yourself. In order to find out if your ego is running the show in a given situation, ask yourself two questions:  ”Do I feel superior to others?” ”Do I feel inferior to others?” If you answered “yes” to either of these your ego is likely running the show. It may make sense to you that feeling superior is a sign of a big ego. You probably didn’t know, however, that feeling lesser than those around you can be an ego problem, too. People with big egos tend to have a problem with others crossing into what they feel is their territory. Your best friend tries to give you some insight on how to perfect your golf skills. Your manager who sits behind a desk all day thinks he can tell you how to do your job better. If you feel a rise after situations similar to those described above, your ego is at play. You may get angry when people try to give you suggestions about things you think you already know. You may refuse help. When people offer up viable ideas that outshine your own, you dismiss them so that your ideas are not diminished. An inflated ego may not always be clearly apparent. Sometimes, having a big ego is demonstrated by how quickly you get offended by opposing views. A person with a big ego tends to think he has it all in the bag. When someone disagrees with your viewpoint or criticizes it, you feel as if your very competence is being questioned. You may have trouble noticing the signs of being easily offended. Observe your interactions for a few days. Are people around you steadily apologizing for ticking you off? Do you always have to calm yourself down after someone angers you? You may be dealing with an ego problem.

"Abuse comes in many forms, but it's important to understand the concepts underlying most types of abuse. Sibling rivalry is common, but if one sibling is always the aggressor and the other always the victim, it is an abusive situation.  Sibling abuse may be physical, emotional, or sexual, and is most often perpetrated by one sibling against the other. Abuse is often an act of power and control. If a sibling tries to make you feel powerless, neglected, or devalued, it is likely an abusive situation. When in doubt, try to seek help through professional opinion and evaluation of the situation. Emotional abuse can stand alone, or it may underpin physical or sexual abuse. Emotional abuse from a sibling is their attempt to control you through manipulation of your thoughts and emotions, making you feel constant fear, shame, or humiliation.  Emotional abuse often makes you feel as though you are walking on eggshells, like anything you do could send your sibling into a rampage or spiral of criticism.  Emotional abuse often leaves victims feeling unheard or unseen, unlovable, and like they don't matter. Emotional abuse may take many forms, but it can include your sibling constantly criticizing your looks, work, or academic performance. It may also include your sibling trying to convince you that you are not respected or wanted by the rest of your family. Physical abuse is using excessive force or doing anything with the intent of causing physical harm to someone else. Physical abuse is generally a controlling act carried out with physical force against another.  Common forms of physical abuse may include hitting, kicking, biting, throwing objects at another, or any other form of physical exertion from an antagonist meant to overpower a victim. Some signs of physical abuse may include bruising, broken bones, burns, bite marks, cuts, abrasions, scarring, and others. Sexual abuse is any unwanted touching, exposure, or forced intimate actions between siblings. It is often the least disclosed and treated form of sibling abuse.  Sibling sexual abuse does not have to include forced sexual acts to be abuse. It may also come in the forms of unwanted exposure or unwanted touching. If you believe there is a problem with sibling sexual abuse in your home, it is advisable to contact law enforcement or a social worker as soon as possible.

"Once you’ve jumped through a sufficient number of bureaucratic hoops, it may finally be time to establish your actual group home.  If you have not already identified a good location, do so now, while keeping in mind potential roadblocks.  Familiarize yourself with local zoning regulations, so you know where you can legally establish a group home.  Also look into local and state requirements for group home facilities; in Connecticut, for instance, there are specific square footage requirements for resident bedroom sizes.  You may face opposition from local residents who are not keen to have a group home in their midst.  They will often cite safety concerns, decreased property values, or even traffic and parking problems as reasons for opposition.  Even if you have verified your legal right to establish your home, be prepared to explain and defend (in a neighborly manner) the benefits your group home will offer to the community. As with any business, it pays to have a clear breakdown of your likely income and expenses in place well before you actually open your doors.  This process will likely make it more clear just how dependent your group home will be on government reimbursement for your services.  Although based on 1998 figures, the sample budget for a group home serving 8-12 children in Georgia provided at https://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/rpt/2003-R-0169.htm may prove a useful point of reference.  Note the estimated expenses of $250,000 per year for a relatively small group home, and the importance the 60% per diem reimbursement rate provided by the state of Georgia after the first year of operation. Basically, don’t expect to make big money by operating a group home.  Focus on the good work you are doing for those in need. Hopefully, you have already prepared yourself for the process of hiring employees, and now you can focus on finding the right people to fill the positions.  Hiring good employees is at least as much of an art as it is a science, but there are steps you can take to improve your odds of making strong hires for your group home.  Finding people with (positive) experience working in a group home setting is great, of course, but don’t automatically exclude everyone without experience.  Consider educational backgrounds and training, as well as temperament and personality traits.  Working in a group home setting requires lots of patience, perseverance, and compassion; it takes the right kind of person with the right kind of attitude to succeed. At the interview, asking questions like ""Can you provide an example of a problem that you successfully solved?"" may offer insights into a potential employee's ambition, ingenuity, and work ethic.  Keep in mind that such questions are common, however, and the interviewee may have prepared stock answers already. (An inability to answer effectively is thus a bad sign.) In addition, try to think up a few problem-solving hypotheticals, for instance, that are specific to the group home setting (“How would you deal with a resident that is / says / does …?""). ”  Once you’ve done all the paperwork and planning, and are ready to open your home, you’ll need to get the “stamp of approval” from your local government authority responsible for group homes.  With this “host letter” (or similarly-styled document, based on your location), the local social / human services department will direct prospective residents your way.  For example, if you are operating a group home for abused children, it will be essential to your survival as a business that such children “in the system” be located with you. Depending upon your location, a legitimate “host letter” (or similar) may be required in order to receive reimbursements.  Inquire with the local government authority responsible for group homes regarding the requirements and process for acquiring this document. Opening a group home isn’t the same as opening an ice cream parlor or repair shop, but any new small business that wants to survive needs to make a strong start.  You’ve been laying the groundwork for a successful opening all along, but you need to spread the word of your opening and make sure the initial experience is a positive one.   How to Open a Small Business offers a nice range of general advice on the topic, much of which is relevant to the group home experience. Advertising is important, even if logo balloons and prize giveaways may not be right for your group home’s grand opening.  But, spreading the word about your business through traditional, digital, and social media methods is still valuable.  For group homes in particular, making connections with the proper government agencies and community organizations — charitable, religious, educational, and so forth — may be your most vital form of advertising.

"Dandelion is an herb which is used as a food additive in various preparations like salads, dressings, teas, coffees, and chocolates. Dandelion is rich in potassium and has a diuretic-like action, meaning it helps clear away excess water from the body. Hence, it’s very useful in increasing the urinary output. As a cleansing agent, taking about 10-15 drops of dandelion mother tincture 3 times a day is useful to detox the kidneys and can be safely continued for up to 6 months. This is an excellent natural supplement for kidney detox. It helps to repair the inflammation and injury caused to the tissues in the kidney as a result of infections or stones. It contains a glycoside known as arbutin which has antimicrobial properties, thereby helping in treating urinary tract infections.  It also has a muscle relaxant-like action which helps to bring down the swelling in the urinary tract or muscles. It neutralizes the acidic content of the urine, thereby alleviating the burning pain caused by infections. It is generally safe to take this supplement. However, you should not take it if you are on antipsychotic drugs like lithium. Uva ursi can interfere with the way the body gets rid of lithium. This could lead to a high level of lithium in the blood, which can be toxic or fatal. This is an Ayurvedic supplement which boosts kidney health and is beneficial to those who suffer from recurrent urinary tract infections as well as recurrent renal stones. It helps in maintaining the flow of urine and also cools and soothes the urinary membranes, thereby relieving the pain. It also possesses antibiotic properties and may help with bladder infections. A capsule of gokshura can be consumed once or twice a day to maintain renal function. This is an age-old supplement known to flush out renal stones. In homeopathy, a mother tincture prepared from this herb, known as Berberis Vulgaris, may help relieve patients from renal colic. However, the size of the stones should be smaller than the diameter of urethra, otherwise a bigger stone can harm the epithelium of the urethra when it attempts to come out. 10-15 drops of the mother tincture mixed with a little water taken 3 times a day may flush out the stones within a few weeks.

"You can honor God by performing good actions for others more casually in your everyday life. Additionally, helping others can help increase your overall appreciation, enjoyment, enlightenment and quality of life. Change up the small, nice things you do for others to keep it new for you.

You might try local places of worship or charity, or use the Yellow Pages under ""Volunteer Center"" or ""Volunteer Clearinghouse"", or you can look online at Volunteermatch.org or 1-800-volunteer.org to find opportunities in areas near you. Consider the following types of volunteering:  Tutoring or volunteering at a school. Translating for immigrants, if you speak another language Coaching a team, if you play a sport Cleaning up and working at a local park or wildlife refuge Working at a local hospital, old folks home, or clinic Calling people for fundraisers from home Over committing to helping others is stressful and will hurt your ability to serve others well. You want to be able to do good things for others with a good attitude. Take some time to consider whether you have the time before committing to do something.  If you have already committed, consider finishing out a portion of the work and then stepping up for another effort. Communicate openly about what is going on with you. People understand that others are busy and will respect you if you communicate with them honestly. Do not be afraid to go back to volunteering for the same organization once you have time to commit again. Pick back up with volunteering, if you had to take a break. Doing things with others often helps provide the motivation you will need to follow through with the work you want to do. In addition, it can help you bond as a friend in the work experience you will have and the new people that you might meet. Consider doing volunteer work with your family, spouse or significant other. This kind of work could help give your relationships healthy perspective and can help create a sense of purpose outside of yourselves.

"The opening of a novel should set the stage and give just enough information to keep the reader interested. Don't give away important details just yet; you want to keep your reader's attention!  Try to avoid laying out the plot of the book or giving a preview of what is to come. You want to keep people guessing. You also do not need to provide the backstory or the whole history of the characters at this point. Instead, work the backstory into the main story as needed to support the ongoing plot. Remember, the backstory isn't the story! This might sound obvious, but most readers are turned off by cliché openings and predictable, cookie cutter descriptions of characters. While there are always well-written exceptions to these rules, avoid:  Opening with a dream sequence that the reader doesn’t realize is a dream. Many readers find this off-putting and deceptive. Similarly, avoid opening with the character waking from sleep or unconsciousness.  Beginning with a description of the cast of characters, like the family, household, or school.  Descriptions of characters faces or bodies that imply they are gorgeous and perfect in every way. Most readers prefer a relatable hero or heroine to one that is flawless and unrealistic. The average beginning of a novel should be as short as you can make it. If possible, start the conflict on page 1. Don't make your reader wait 50 to 100 pages before they get to the good stuff!  Don't get lost in tedious description. Your reader wants some action and plot advancement, not to get stuck in the details of a description of the countryside or of the  main character's face, body, clothes, and personality.  The introduction should be long enough to cover the subject but short enough to keep it interesting. Interesting and luring introductions grab readers into the story and make them want to read more. Just give the details that are needed to get the reader feeling oriented in the setting and familiar enough with the character to visualize him or her. Most readers enjoy using their imagination to make the characters come to life, so don't feel that you need to describe everything about him or her.

"Adhesive hooks come in different weight capacities, and you'll want to make sure the hooks you get are strong enough to hold up your curtains and curtain rod so they don't fall. Generally, adhesive hooks that can hold up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg) should work.  You'll need 2 adhesive hooks per pair of curtains you want to hang up. You can find adhesive hooks online or at your local hardware store. Since you'll be using 2 adhesive hooks, each hook only needs to hold half of the weight of your curtains. For example, if your curtains and curtain rod weigh 32 pounds (15 kg) in total, you would need 2 adhesive hooks that can hold up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg) each. Many adhesive hook brands have stylized versions, made with steel or wood rather than plastic. Opt for these varieties if the aesthetic of your curtains is important to you. Draw a square at least 2 in (5.1 cm) wide in the corner of the piece of cardboard. Then, cut it out with scissors to create a right angle. You'll use the piece of cardboard with the right angle in the corner to mark where you want to hang up your adhesive hooks so they're level with each other. The corner of the window should be aligned with the right angle you cut out of the cardboard. Hold one of the adhesive hooks over the cardboard where you want to hang it, and mark the bottom of it on the cardboard with a pencil. Keep the cardboard aligned with the corner of the window while you puncture it with the pencil. You want the mark on the wall to be directly behind the mark on the cardboard. Try twisting and pressing on the pencil simultaneously to puncture the cardboard. Align the right angle on the cardboard with the other side of the window, and use the pencil to make a mark through the hole you punctured in it. Now you should have a mark on each side of the window to show you where to hang your adhesive hooks. The marks should be level. Take the adhesive strip off of the back of your hooks and press them firmly on the wall so the marks you made are lined up with the bottoms of the hooks. Make sure you press on the hooks for 30 seconds so the adhesive sticks. The adhesive on the hooks needs time to dry before it's secure. If you try to hang your curtains on the hooks too soon, they might fall down. The exact amount of time you should wait may vary depending on the kind of adhesive hooks you're using. Refer to the packaging for specific instructions. Your curtain rod should balance perfectly on the hooks. If it slides or tilts in one direction, the hooks might not be level. Try removing one of the hooks and checking to see that the marks are level. Run the curtain rod through the hoops at the top of your curtains and then hang it up again. Draw the curtains and let them sit for 1 hour to make sure the adhesive hooks can hold the weight. If your curtain falls, either the adhesive didn't fully stick to the wall or your curtain may be too heavy for the hooks. Consider buying higher-weight capacity hooks, or use 2 adjacent hooks on each side to balance the weight a little better.

String your curtain on the curtain rod and hang it up.
"Buy some books about how to survive in the wilderness. The wilderness section of the local bookstore or library will help you. In addition to wilderness skills, you'll need to understand the essentials of survival (food, water, shelter) and plan to ensure all of these.  Understand how to forage and hunt for your own food in a remote environment. Figure out what you'll need to do in the case of dangerous weather (flooding, lightning strike, blizzard) while you're in the wilderness. You're not going to be able to drop out of society in a place like the city, so do some planning and figure out where you're going to go. Go somewhere with a low population and a ready food source—whether fertile ground that can be planted with a garden, or a nearby stream to catch fish in.   Large amounts of vegetation and animal population are good indicators of a natural environment that can support life. Make sure that you have a constant and nearby water source. This could be a river or stream, a natural spring, or a lake.  Water is the most important element for survival, and you'll need to use it on a daily basis, so make sure the water is clean and plentiful. Research the types of wildlife that you can expect in whatever location you choose to live in. For example, if you're in a forest, are you likely to encounter bears? It's important to know how to survive outside of society before you drop out, especially if you're going to be living in a harsh or remote area. Start by learning how to use basic weapons and tools: a knife, a shovel, rake, hoe, and potentially a gun that is suitable for bringing down most animals without damaging their meat.  You'll likely need to make serious changes to your diet. Living remotely, you'll need to sustain yourself, and this can be done through eating animal proteins and foraging, or growing vegetables in a small garden.  You should also look into learning how to preserve (dry or pickle) meat and vegetables, so you will have enough food to survive during winter months. Unless you're planning to live in an already-existing “off the grid” house or rent a cabin, you'll likely need to build your own housing. You can either purchase construction materials before you leave society, or use natural materials (trees, etc.) found in the woods.  Consider that your accommodation will also need to be repaired and renovated from time to time. You'll need to have money saved up to invest in these expenses.  You should also have a plan in place for finding land to live on. The most legal method is to find a cheap, remote plot of land and purchase it. If you would prefer not to own land, or plan to move around frequently, you may find yourself living illegally on National Forest or private property.

"A fitted tank top with a high crew neckline can look lovely when paired with a cardigan sweater or fitted denim jacket. Add style to your look by choosing one with a fun print or embellishments at the collar. If you fall in love with a top or dress that has a deep v-neck or low square neckline, do not despair. A plain camisole or one with feminine lace detailing at the neck can transform that garment into something that will work with your modest wardrobe. Many camisoles have adjustable straps, so you can extend the neckline of the camisole to cover up any cleavage or uncomfortable amounts of skin. Think shawls, denim jackets, leather jackets, cardigan sweaters, blazers, military-style jackets, and more. The more variety you have in your outerwear, the more looks you can create. Outerwear is great for layering over pieces with low-cut backs or skinny straps. If you want to wear a dress or skirt, but worry that the hemline might be a bit too short, compensate by wearing something beneath it. Skinny jeans and leggings work well for many pieces. Be aware that many leggings may still look immodest, however, since they have a tendency to sculpt your body. To avoid this, only wear leggings with a skirt that covers your rear and most of your thighs. Do not wear super-short mini skirts that reveal everything the moment you sit down.

"It’ll be much easier to listen to English-language materials if they’re about things you like! Make a list of 5 things you’re interested in learning about. You can then look up podcasts and audiobooks about those 5 subjects. TV series are a good spot for you to start out, as you’ll be able to read lips and facial expressions to help you understand what’s going on. Once you’ve gotten better at listening to English being spoken, however, it’s a good idea to move on from TV or movies. Listening without seeing is tougher, and you don’t want the visuals to become a crutch. The best part about podcasts is that you can find thousands of them for free! Download them onto your phone or tablet so you can listen to them while you’re driving, on the train, or even waiting in line at the grocery store.  If you’re struggling to find a podcast, look up lists of popular English-language podcasts about things like politics or entertainment. You can also ask friends and family for recommendations. Just like podcasts, you can listen to audiobooks when you’re on the move or doing laundry at home. Audiobooks may be more useful than podcasts for exposing you to new vocabulary. They’ll also help you learn English grammar rules. However, it may take you awhile to finish 1 audiobook, so be sure to choose one that excites you! Go online to find lists of popular audiobooks. If you’d like, you can also listen to English-language “classics” like Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, or Toni Morrison’s Beloved. Because the music itself may cover up the lyrics, it’ll be tough to understand what’s going in songs when you first start studying. However, this is a good way to make listening harder for yourself! Go online to find song lyrics so you can double check your comprehension. Sing along to really commit the words to your memory!

"In the current digital age, it is essential that you maintain an online presence to promote your writing and showcase it to editors in the industry. You should have an online portfolio, a personal website, and/or a blog that you update regularly.   Your portfolio or website should have your biography, a blog documenting your past traveling experiences and any upcoming travel, with lots of detailed write ups of your experiences, as well as social media feeds where you can promote and share your articles, photos and videos.  Use your portfolio as a platform to engage readers, viewers, and editors in the industry. Linking to your website when you meet an editor or a possible writing contact will ensure someone is paying attention to your online persona and could lead to writing contracts or offers. One of the best ways to kick start your career is to focus on local events and activities in your hometown or city. Focus on a new interesting food craze in your town or a brand new music festival in your city. Writing about your hometown can give you access to material that is easy to cover, with very cheap travel fees.  As a travel writer, you will need to be able to move past superficial descriptions of a place and see a place in an authentic and interesting way. Writing about things in your area will allow you to build a strong body of work around a certain niche or location and help you practice “seeing” a place from a deeper, more engaging perspective. One way you can create your own local writing prompts is to google your local place + “travel”. For example, “Reno travel”. Look at what comes up first in the search results and ask yourself if you could provide a well written article with more useful information. If the answer is yes, you may have found your first travel writing story. While it is very important to network with contacts online, using your online presence you should also network offline by meeting face to face with individuals in the industry. Look for travel writing conferences in your area or close to your area. Search online for travel writer meet up groups that you can join. Focus on introducing yourself and asking more seasoned writers who they are working for and what they are currently working on. This will help to give you a sense of the current state of the industry and what types of stories editors are looking for.

"Depending on the application conventions in the industry you’re applying in, it may be inappropriate to include your hobbies on your resume at all. The potential employer may find it irrelevant and you don’t want that feeling to be attached to your application.  Research the corporate culture of the company you’re applying to. Some companies encourage employees to bring their interests into the creative workplace, for example, Google explicitly cultivates an “open culture” workplace where hobbies are welcomed. A hobbies section would be very appropriate for an application in the tech industry with a company like Google. However, if you’re applying for a position at an accounting firm, the corporate culture may not be as welcoming of your hobbies. Leave them off that resume. Whereas a college admissions officer is looking to get a sense of how you might develop over the course of your undergraduate career, a potential employer wants to know, as concisely as possible, whether you would fit into the workplace or not. Stick to 7 words or less per hobby or interest. Don’t dwell on how you feel at one with nature when you go biking every morning if you're applying for a job with a consulting firm. Simply say that you bike regularly and participate in races. Don’t list an interest if you’re not actually passionate about it — if it comes up in an interview, your lack of passion and knowledge will give you away as a resume passer.  Choose interests that not only mean a lot to you, but also demonstrate the kind of person you are. For example, “reading” is a fairly generic activity that doesn’t reveal that much about you. However, running marathons suggests that you possess a high level of dedication and that you can overcome obstacles. ""Listening to music"" doesn't tell your employee anything about you, but ""I have practiced classical piano for 17 years,"" tells them a lot. ""Volunteering,"" tells the employer something about you, but it's not as detailed as it could be. Say, instead, that you've volunteered weekly at the same soup kitchen for 3 years, or that you bring your expertise from your state champion high school football team to bear when volunteering as a coach for community football league. Generally, hobbies that show leadership skills, personal initiative, dedication, or drive are good boosters for your resume. Wherever possible, demonstrate how the skills and qualities you develop through your hobbies make you a better candidate for the position for which you’re applying. For example, a consulting firm may not care about what how biking up a mountain brings you closer to nature, but they will want to know that you have participated in several large-scale races that required dedication and grit in training, or that you suffered a serious injury that at some point threatened to derail your hobby, but that you are not fazed by obstacles, and you worked through it.

"As you are doing this, turn your turn signal on so that cars behind you know to drive around.  The open spot should always be on your right.  Never park crossing over to the other side of the street.  Your bumper should cover half of the end of the parking space. Make sure to look out for pedestrians before you begin backing up. Turn your wheel all the way to the right before you begin moving the car.  Press on the gas gently as your car begins to turn.  Because your wheel is all the way to the right, your car will move left when it is in reverse.  Continue to look in your mirrors and check for pedestrians and the edges of the cars surrounding the parking space. Turn your car to the left until your car is parallel with the parking space, equidistant on both sides.  After it is parallel, press on the brakes and hold your car steady.  Turn your wheel so that your tires are now straight. Check your mirrors first to make sure that there is enough room on both sides of the parking space.  Do not back up if there are people behind you.  Let the brakes go, and gently press on the accelerator with your car still in reverse.  Let your car slowly move back into the space. Take it slow.  Continuously check the mirrors, and back out, if you are getting too close to one of the cars on the sides. Switch between forward and reverse, moving a few inches at a time.  Turn your wheel either way.  You want the space on both sides of your car to be even.  Once your car is safely backed into the space, put your car into park and turn off the engine. Open the driver's door slightly to see whether there is enough room to get out.  You may have to hold the door only slightly open as you get out.  Make sure not to sling the door open, otherwise you could damage the car behind you.  Once you are out, lock your car and you are good to go. Turn your car on and put it in forward.  Go forward slightly as you press on the accelerator.  As you begin to creep out of your parking space, tilt your head forward to make sure there are no cars or pedestrians coming by.  Continue out of the space straight until your bumper is fully past the cars on either side. Turn your wheel whatever direction you want to go and press on the accelerator.

"If you and your crush talk often or hang out in or outside of school, pay attention to changes in their attitude. If they used to be friendly and playful but suddenly start acting distant and moody, it’s possible that they are having conflicting feelings. If this is happening, try to not get super clingy. Give your crush a little bit of space so they can figure out how they feel. It could be a good time for you to evaluate your feelings, too. Look out for signs like your crush no longer saying “hi” to you in the hallway or waiting to walk to class with you. If you had normal interactions with your crush on a daily basis and they start to diminish, your crush might have changing feelings. Being ignored outright is a clear sign that your crush doesn’t feel the same way anymore. Especially if this change correlates to them starting to treat someone else more affectionately. If you and your crush are friends and hang out regularly, pick up on times when they bail on plans or ditch you. This is a pretty good sign that there might be something or someone else they are hoping to spend time with. Similarly, if your crush suddenly becomes hard to pin down or avoids making plans with you, it could be a sign of a similar situation. If you’re used to quick responses and frequent messages with your crush and that suddenly slows down or stops, there is probably a reason for it. It’s possible that something else is going on, but if this change is consistent for several weeks it might be because they are busy messaging someone else. You could also ask them directly if everything is okay. Maybe they’re having a hard time or are overwhelmed with school or work. If you’re close friends, it could be worth bringing it up. If your crush is continually talking about a new person, it could be because they are attracted to or interested in them. If the same name keeps creeping up every time you interact, pay attention—this could be the sign you’re looking for. It’s totally possible your crush doesn’t even realize they’re doing this. Think about how many times you’ve probably mentioned your crush to your friends in passing before you realized you were talking about them so much.

Provide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:

",Watch for changes in how moody your crush is when you spend time together. Take note of how your crush acts when they see you in person. Pay attention to canceled plans as a sign your crush is into someone else. Observe how quickly (or slowly) they respond to your messages. Listen to how often they name-drop during your conversations.
"There are several varieties of booster seats to choose from. They vary in design, material, and price. Choose one that fits your vehicle, suits your child, and meets your current and future needs.  Backless booster seats do not have a back (as the name suggests), but rest on your vehicle's rear seat. Your child's back is supported by the back of the vehicle's seat. High back booster seats have their own support for your child's back to rest against. These fit within your vehicle's rear seat much like a forward-facing child safety seat. High back booster seats are recommended for vehicles without headrests on the rear seat.  Combination child safety seat/booster seats can be used first as a child safety seat and then converted to a booster seat when your child is old enough or big enough. Booster seats are not latched to your car in the same way that car seats are. Instead, they are held in place by your child's weight and your car's seat belt. For this reason, it is very important to find a booster seat that you child can sit comfortably on. Choose a booster seat that is neither too large nor too small for your child. A booster seat will rest on top of your car's back seat, much like a car seat. It will also be strapped in using the car's seatbelt. Therefore, it is critical that the booster seat fit properly into your car and onto the rear seat. Make sure:  The booster seat fits fully on your car's rear seat, and does not hang over the edge. The booster seat sits flat on your car's rear seat, and is not turned or tilted. At least one of your car's rear lap-shoulder seatbelts (not just a lap seatbelt) is able to fit fully around the booster seat so that you can secure it in place. As soon as you have purchased a booster seat, register it with the manufacturer, according to the instructions that are provided with the packaging. This is necessary to validate the warranty, and will also help the manufacturer notify you in the event that there is a recall on the booster seat.

"Once you get your bidet, follow the instructions in the package to set it up. Some manufacturers also have installation videos on YouTube that you can watch if you want to see someone completing the process.Some bidet seats might not fit on your toilet bowl perfectly. However, they'll usually still work. If the seat doesn't fit your toilet bowl, test to make sure the bidet isn't spraying or leaking on the floor when it's used. Once you've got your bidet seat up and running, it's time to take it for a test drive. Use your toilet the same way you normally would, then trigger the bidet instead of reaching for toilet paper. If you've never used a bidet before, it can take some getting used to. However, over time you might find that you actually feel cleaner with the bidet than you ever did with toilet paper.

"Inspect the condition of your foundation. If repairs need to be made to floorboards, do so now. The less work done after the rail installation, the better in order to make sure the handrail stays intact for as long as possible. To install a handrail using balusters, rather than installing one on a wall, you'll need quite a few materials in addition to the handrail you have chosen. If you're installing double handrails, one on either side of your set of stairs, double the quantity of supplies you purchase.  Your handrail should be a 2x4 piece of wood that is no longer than 8 feet long, according to most building codes. Purchase two newel posts, the supporting posts that hold up the rail; you'll need one for the top of the stairs and one for the base. The standard size of a post is 4x4 inches and 5 feet long. Purchase one baluster per stair step. Balusters are the spindles that connect the rail to each step. The height of the balusters should be between 30 and 36 inches, depending on how high you want the railing to be. If there are already posts and/or balusters in place, count the total numbers of pieces you will need to replace, if any. For secure installation of newel posts, you'll need a post-hole digger and concrete mix to pour into the holes.  Purchase sure-tite fasteners for secure installation of balusters in the steps. You'll need wood glue or epoxy glue to fasten the handrail to the posts. Depending on the style of railing you install, you may need additional reinforcement supplies, such as a finish nail gun and a screwdigger. If you're replacing an old handrail, your set of stairs may already have newel posts at the top and bottom that you can use to support your new handrail. If not, you'll need to install posts before you can install your rail.  To install a post in the ground, use a post-hole digger to dig a hole least 18 inches in depth in front of the bottom step. Fill the hole halfway to the top with mixed, wet concrete. Stand a newel post in the hole. If you're installing two posts, use a 4-foot level to stand on the top of both posts to ensure that they posts are perfectly aligned with one another vertically. Use the same level to ensure that the posts are horizontally aligned and level, too. Wait 24 hours for the concrete to set before installing the handrail. To install a top post to a wooden deck, place post over the stair stringer in a plumb position. Use four timber lock screws and wood glue to secure it into place. Finish it with finishing nails. Balusters should be spaced no more than 4 inches apart. Use a pencil to mark the place where each baluster will be installed. Make sure the balusters are lined up with the newel posts at either end of the stairs.  Drill holes into each step, then thread the holes with sure-tite fasteners. If your balusters don't already have holes, you'll need to drill them. Drill a standard sized access hole into the bottom of the balusters. Into the side of each baluster, drill another access hole horizontally to intersect the first hole. Set each baluster, or spindle, onto the sure-tite fasteners on each step. Tighten them down with a wrench. Apply wood glue or epoxy glue to the top of the posts.  Fit the handrail into place. Wait 24 hours for the glue to dry before using the handrail, then secure the handrail and balusters together one at a time with a finish nail gun.  For extra reinforcement, you can screw the handrail to the post with a Screwdigger, using a wood screw of 100-120 mm in size.  Position the screw behind the post and make sure that it is going through both the posts and the handrail. If the handrail is unfinished, finishing it is the last step. After allowing the glue to dry completely, use a sturdy paintbrush to apply a topcoat of primer onto the railing from the top down, ensuring that all surfaces and nooks are covered. After the topcoat dries, apply a second coat.  If you wish to paint your stairs and railing, use an oil based paint because it preserves the wood grain while protecting the wood against harsh weather conditions. Use the same technique as the primer and topcoat when making the application. If staining is more your preference than painting, choose a wood stain that contains a deck sealer to preserve the look and feel of the wood.

"Work in a well-ventilated area in your home, and mix the bleach and water in a small container. Be careful not to use more bleach or else it could give your white shoes a yellow tinge.  Bleach works best for white fabric shoes. Wear nitrile gloves while working with bleach to prevent any skin irritation. Dip the toothbrush in your bleach solution and start scrubbing your shoes. Focus on soiled areas and deep stains, applying slight pressure to the fabric. You should notice the stains lift out of the fabric. Start with your shoes’ fabric before moving onto harder surfaces, like the soles. Wet a soft microfiber towel in clean warm water and wring it out until it’s damp. Apply gentle pressure as you wipe the towel over your shoes. You can also remove the insoles from your shoes and run your shoes under the faucet. Leave your shoes in the room to dry for at least 5-6 hours before you plan on wearing them again. Try to let them dry overnight if you can to dry completely.

"Dampen the cloth in vinegar, then wring it out to remove excess moisture. Before you place it on the carpet, make sure it isn’t dripping. Vinegar is also effective on other surfaces, from clothing to metal. It is worth a try as a natural solution or if other treatments fail. Apply the salt directly to the carpet. Cover the stain in an even layer of the salt. Position the cloth so it covers the stain. The salt draws the rust up out of the carpet fibers, while the vinegar dissolves it. The vinegar also neutralizes any unpleasant odors in the treated area. Add more vinegar to the cloth to saturate it. Wring it out again to prevent it from dripping vinegar everywhere. Then, lay it over the stain and wait another 30 minutes. You may need to do this a few times to remove tough stains. Older and deeper stains take repeated treatments. After the stain vanishes, wait for the carpet to dry completely to the touch. Then, vacuum the area to remove any salt left in the carpet fibers. Vacuuming will also perk up the carpet’s fibers, making them look fresh and fluffy again.

"For this project, you'll need quite a bit of tissue paper. The tissue paper will cover the entire paper globe lantern in a pattern, so you'll need to acquire enough tissue paper to do this. You can use all one color tissue paper, or choose to make your lantern multi-colored. Pick whatever color combination you desire, or whatever makes sense for how you intend to use the lantern. Use any circle-shaped object (a coffee can lid, a small salad plate, etc.) as a pattern to trace circles on the tissue paper. Depending on the size of your circles, you'll need about 100 tissue paper circles. Trace your circle pattern on your tissue paper, keeping the circles as close together as possible to avoid wasting too much excess tissue paper. Don't make your circles too big or too small. If they are too big, the lantern won't be very billowy; and if your circles are too small, you'll be making much more work for yourself than necessary. Aim for something the size of a coffee can lid. Use scissors to cut out all of your tissue paper circles. Handle the tissue paper carefully because it is very thin and will tear easily. Repeat Step 5 until the entire paper globe lantern is covered in tissue paper circles. As you move up with each row, ensure that about one inch of the row below is visible underneath. This will give your final product a layered, patterned look.

"Being mindful of your impulses can help you correct them. Whenever you feel the urge to stare, make a mental note about it. Over time you will recognize triggers that make you want to stare and you can work on ignoring them. Let the impulse you’re feeling disappear by distracting yourself with counting. If you count to ten and you still want to stare, keep counting higher until the urge is gone. Whenever you feel the urge to stare at a girl’s chest, do something else instead. Try looking up at the ceiling, checking your phone, tapping a finger against your palm, or rolling up the sleeves of your shirt. The behavior itself isn’t important; you just want to have a go-to habit that you can do instead of staring whenever you get the urge. If you or the girl are distressed by your staring, and you can't stop, take a break. Politely end the conversation you’re having and leave. In some cases, it’s better to acknowledge your impulse in your head and remove yourself from the situation than it is to stare.  For example, you could excuse yourself to go use the restroom. Return when you feel calm enough to control your behavior.

"Instead of trying to harden gum by freezing it, you can instead soften it further with heat.  This is faster, but a bit more risky, because you can scorch the cotton or overheat the gum and make an even bigger mess.  Set the dryer on a medium or low setting, and wave it back and forth so no one spot overheats. Keep going until the gum appears to be on the verge of melting. Put gloves on (because the gum may be very hot in spots), and peel the gum away.  If sufficiently heated, it should pull away easily. If you don’t have a hair dryer, or happen to have your iron out anyway, you can use the latter item to soften and peel away the gum.  Once again, though, be careful not to scorch the garment or melt the gum into a puddle of sticky goo.  Place a piece of cardboard on your ironing board.  Place the garment, gum side down, on top of the cardboard. Set your iron to medium to prevent scorching or overheating.  Run the iron over the back side of the gum spot as you normally would. Check your progress occasionally.  When the gum is sufficiently heated, it should peel right away from the clothing and stick instead to the cardboard. The process for removing any remaining stickiness or residue is the same whether you freeze or heat the gum off. Blot, wipe, or lightly scrub away any gum remnants with a color- and fabric-safe spot cleaner or with laundry detergent, then launder as usual.

"Your life is full of interesting experiences! Just think of all the times you’ve told friends or family members stories about yourself. One of these stories might make a great book!  Turn your life stories into fiction using your imagination! Change the names of everyone involved, and add a few exciting incidents that didn’t really happen. For example, you could write a book inspired by your experiences at camp, about starring in a school play alongside your crush, or about the trials and tribulations you faced while trying out for a team. Historical events, especially if they’re personal, can be a great source of inspiration. Just as your life experiences are interesting, those of your relatives and ancestors are, as well. Ask your parents and grandparents to tell you their favorite family stories. Then, turn 1 of those stories into a book.  You can write the story as non-fiction, meaning it’s a true story, or you can use your imagination to make it fiction. For example, you could write a book about how your grandparents reunited after World War II. You might insert your main character into an event that actually happened. Alternatively, you could just write about a character than lives in a time period you think is interesting. Think about historical events or periods you liked learning about in history class.  Do some research about the period. For example, you might write a book that takes place in Ancient Egypt. You can create a realistic story set in a different time period, or you can use history to inspire a fantasy story. You’ve probably read social media threads where the poster typed out a conversation they overheard, sometimes with added commentary. You could do something similar when writing your book! Listen to a conversation in a public place, then write a book about the people who are having it. Consider using this conversation as your first chapter. What happens next? Where will these characters end up? You know that reading lets you get into someone else’s mind or travel to a new land. So can writing! Your book is a great opportunity to create a world all your own.  Write a book about a character who shares your favorite hobby. Give your main character a talent you’ve always wanted to have. Write a book about your favorite fantasy creature, such as a vampire, mermaid, fairy, or elf. Base a book on a game you like to play. You can find writing prompts online, or you could buy a book of prompts. There are even random prompt generators online that will provide you with a unique prompt! Prompts can give you fun ideas for your book.  You could try combining two prompts to make something new.

"Feeling tired can be caused by increased fluid volume in the body. This causes the different body systems to be overworked. You may also start feeling very weak, which can be perceived as being fatigued. The feeling of being excessively itchy is caused by the accumulation of the waste products in the blood stream, as the diseased liver is not able to perform its function of removing waste products. When the liver becomes damaged, it has a harder time producing blood clotting factors. This problem can lead to red palms, as well as nose bleeds. You may also notice that you begin to pass black tarry stools. Damage to the liver means that it is unable to accumulate glycogen, a carbohydrate that provides the body with temporary energy. When the liver is damaged, it forces the body to use its muscle tissue to supply energy in between meals and this causes weakness and muscle wasting, which in turn causes weight loss. When the liver stops functioning properly, it is unable to perform its tasks that it normally does effortlessly. Toxins will begin to accumulate in your blood which can cause a loss of appetite or a feeling of nausea.

"Press the dough with the heel of your palm into a rectangle roughly 20-25cm or 8-10 inches long. Fold this dough in half (width-wise) and press to seal. Fold again in half to make a long loaf. Find the seam and pinch it shut if it seems open. Using your palms, start at the middle and roll the dough outwards. The bread should end up a little fatter in the middle and thinner at the ends. The seams should be well sealed, otherwise pinch them shut again. The loaf should be about 40-50cm or so long, ideally longer if your oven may permit its size. In practice, do not roll out a loaf bigger than you can bake. Use a floured linen or cotton tea towel, or use a baguette mould. If using a cloth, place the loaf seam side up (so the good side is face down) and pleat the cloth to support the bread and leave in a warm place. Repeat with the other half of the dough if desired or make other shapes. To apply sesame seeds, poppy seeds or other grains (which are not traditional on French style Baguettes, mist the top of the dough with a spray bottle of water and roll the baguette gently into a tray that has the seeds spread into it before you place it on the cloth or baking tray. This gives a more even coating than sprinkling by hand. When it has proofed and ready to bake, gently turn the bread over (so it is now good side up) and use a sharp razor blade to slash the bread very gently on a regular diagonal pattern 4–5 times. Kitchen knives are typically too blunt to do this well. Cut only a millimetre or so into the bread. Close the door quickly and bake 20-25 minutes, turn off the oven but leave them in for another 10-15 to further form their crust.  You may also use this method to make a long very thin loaf, which you may then cut up (or divide the dough up into smaller loaves) to make thin bread sticks like the Italian grissini loaves. You may also divide the 1kg dough into 10 portions and follow the same method to make hot dog rolls, or from hot dog rolls, press the two ends together to make a loop like a bagel.

"Even if you eliminate roaches from your specific apartment, they will keep returning if the building is not treated. Roaches can inhabit the walls and spaces between units, or travel between units in a building. They love the carbohydrates and sugar found in your food, soaps, and even plants.  Keep food (for humans and pets) in glass or plastic containers, with lids that fit tightly. Transfer any food that you keep in bags, boxes, or other materials that are easy for roaches to chew through. Replace bar soap with liquid soap dispensers, and spread a bit of petroleum jelly on plant holders and pots to keep roaches away from the plants in your apartment. Keep garbage, compost and recycling in tightly sealed containers, and take out your garbage frequently. Crumbs, spills, and stains will attract roaches. Clean kitchen surfaces thoroughly after preparing food. Sweep up crumbs and mop up spills immediately. Scrub inside cabinets and around and under appliances. Take extra care to sweep and scrub up any roach droppings that you find, since these can attract other roaches. Roaches like to hide in boxes, stacks of paper, or piles of laundry. Avoid storing paper bags, magazines, or newspapers on the floor or in cabinets. Keep your bathroom and kitchen as dry as possible. If you have leaky pipes or worn grout, bring them to your landlord’s attention. Mop up spilled water immediately, and wipe down sinks and bathtubs immediately after use. You may wish to empty pet water dishes overnight. Roaches travel in and out of walls, doors and windows through cracks as small as 1/5 inch (0.5 cm).

If you get some recommendations, check out the stylists Instagram or other social media feeds where they post photos of their work. If your regular stylist has experience with platinum blonde coloring, then you might simply go for a consultation with them. However, if you do not currently have a stylist or your stylist has expressed discomfort with taking you to this color, then call around to find someone who has experience turning people into platinum blondes. Try saying something like, “I want to go platinum blonde without too much damage to my hair, and my current hair color is ____. Do any of your stylists have experience with this type of situation?” After you find someone who has experience, you can make a consultation appointment. Sometimes you can just drop into the salon and see the stylist between clients, but it is best to ask first.  Try saying something like, “I would like to stop in and talk with the stylist before I make an appointment. Do I need to make a consultation appointment, or can I just stop by when the stylist is working?” Make sure to bring picture with you to your consultation so you can show the stylist what you want your hair to look like. Before you decide to make your first hair appointment with a stylist, it is a good idea to ask questions. This will help you to get a sense of how much experience the stylist has and how comfortable you feel trusting your hair to them.  How many times have you taken someone from a shade similar to mine to a platinum blonde shade? What process did you use to get the desired color without causing too much damage? How many appointments do you think it would take to get me to a platinum blonde shade? Do you have any photos of your work? If you feel comfortable with the stylist, then you can make an appointment with them. Be aware that you may not leave the appointment as a platinum blonde, but this is a safer route than trying to go platinum blonde in a day. Try to be patient with the process. Keep in mind that going platinum with a professional can cost upwards of $300, and you also have to maintain it with regular root touch-ups and special brass banishing shampoo and conditioners. However, getting your hair done professionally will likely yield better results and it is also safer.

"Parents are often more distressed than their teenagers by bickering or minor, day-to-day arguments. They may still be troubled by a conflict that you have almost forgotten about. If your parent still seems upset about an old conflict, don’t dismiss their feelings. Instead, ask them what is still bothering them, and listen thoughtfully to their answer. Teenagers and parents often frame conflicts in different ways. Teenagers are more likely to emphasize personal choice, while their parents are more likely to focus on underlying issues of right versus wrong. For example, you might see your messy room as just one way to live, while your parent might see a certain level of dirtiness as fundamentally wrong. While it can be frustrating, try not to tell your parents that their way of seeing things is completely wrong. Instead, focus on practical issues: how often do your parents expect you to do your laundry? Will your mess bother them less if the door is shut? You are likely to be more emotional at this phase of your life. In addition, you might tend to see emotion in others, even when it’s not there. Practice reality testing: ask your parents calmly how they feel about something, or even ask them directly: “Were you angry at me when I came in just now?” Doing fun activities together can help foster a good relationship with your parents. It’s helpful for them to see you out in the world, navigating different situations with maturity and grace. For example, inviting your parents to go on a hike with you might help them to feel more open to allowing you to go on an overnight camping trip later on. Teenagers naturally seek out stronger connections with their peers than with their parents. If you let your parents get to know your friends, however, it will be easier for them to be open to letting you spend time with them later at night or in more independent ways. If you are able to talk seriously and openly about adult issues such as sex, relationships, and your future, you will have a better and more adult relationship with your parents. Asking their advice about relationships and preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections can help your parents to see that you are approaching this issue maturely. In addition, you’ll learn from their own experiences of sex and romance.  Use an example from a television show or magazine article to raise a particular topic. Write down questions you want to ask. Send a text message or e-mail to break the ice. You can use this message as a way to set up a time to talk later, when you will be both be able to concentrate on the conversation. Some conflict is normal during this period of your relationship with your parents, but frequent, very intense fights are a sign that something is wrong. If you can’t stop fighting with your parents, ask a trusted outside adult for help and guidance.

"BUD/S candidates say that when you’re freezing cold, it’s almost impossible to fall asleep.   They are subjected to up to 15 minutes immersed in water that is barely above 60°F (15.6°C). Be careful, however, because exposure to extreme cold can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as hypothermia.  Have your friend drink a cold beverage. Make an ice bath for your buddy and have her sit in it for 10 minutes. Adjust the air conditioning to make the room cool or cold. Have your friend take a cold 10-minute shower. People are less likely to fall asleep when they are uncomfortable, according to one military member who successfully completed Hell Week.  Get “wet and sandy."" Jump into a body of water then roll around in the sand like BUD/S candidates do. Sit in the most uncomfortable chair available. Take away your friend’s pillow and blankets.

"A gene is a piece of ""genetic code"" that determines a trait in a living organism – for example, eye color. But eye color can be blue, or brown, or various other colors. These variations of the same gene are called alleles. All your genes together make your genotype: the entire length of DNA that describes how to build you. Your actual body and behavior are your phenotype: how you ended up, partly because of genes but also because of diet, possible injury, and other life experiences. In sexually reproducing organisms, including humans, each parent passes on one gene for each trait. The child keeps the genes from both parents. For each trait, the child might have two copies of the same allele, or two different alleles.  An organism with two copies of the same allele is homozygous for that gene.  An organism with two different alleles is heterozygous for that gene. The simplest genes have two alleles: one dominant and one recessive. The dominant variation shows up even if a recessive allele is also present. A biologist would say that the dominant allele is ""expressed in the phenotype.""  An organism with one dominant allele and one recessive allele is heterozygous dominant. These organism are also called carriers of the recessive allele, since they have the allele but don't show the trait.  An organism with two dominant alleles is homozygous dominant. An organism with two recessive alleles is homozygous recessive. Two alleles of the same gene that can combine to make three different colors are called incomplete dominants. An example of this are cream-dilute horses, where cc horses are red, Cc horses are a shade of gold, and CC horses are a light shade of cream. The end result of a Punnett square is a probability. A 25% chance at red hair doesn't mean that exactly 25% of the children will have red hair; it's just an estimate. However, even a rough prediction can be informative in some situations:  Someone running a breeding project (usually developing new plant strains) wants to know which breeding pair gives the best chance at good results, or whether a certain breeding pair is worth the effort. Someone with a serious genetic disorder, or a carrier of an allele for a genetic disorder, wants to know the possibility that he'll pass it on to his children.

"Tip the wet saw on its side and unscrew the nut holding the blade in place. Lift the current saw blade out from the machine carefully so you don’t cut your hand. Insert your diamond blade so the teeth face in the cutting direction before securing it in place with the nut again. Use a socket wrench to tighten the nut completely. How you change the saw blade and the direction it spins depends on the model of wet saw that you have. Consult the instruction manual to learn how to properly install the blade. Water in a wet saw helps cool down the blade and reduces the amount of dust. Locate the tray on the bottom of your wet saw for the water reservoir. Fill the reservoir with water until the bottom of the blade is slightly submerged.  Wet saws kick up water while you use them, so you may need to refill the reservoir if you plan on cutting multiple tiles. Since you’re working electronics and water, plug the saw into a GFCI outlet. GFCI outlets will automatically turn off the power if any of the electronic components in your saw get wet. The fence is the straightedge piece that attaches to the base of your wet saw. Hold the marble tile that you’re cutting against the edge of the fence to see where it lines up with your saw. Adjust the fence closer or further from the blade until your mark lines up with the saw. Saw blades usually cut out 1⁄8 inch (0.32 cm) from your material, so make sure your blade is on the scrap side of your line. Flip your tile over so the finished side faces the bottom of your saw. Turn on your saw using the switch on the side of the front of the saw. Guide the saw forward until you cut 1 in (2.5 cm) in from the edge. Making this relief cut prevents the tile from chipping or breaking when you cut through it completely. Make sure the finished side of your tile is face up for the remainder of your cut. Start from the side of your mark that hasn’t been cut yet. Slowly push the tile forward to feed it through the saw. Once the tile is cut, turn your saw off before removing the tile from your work surface. If you’re cutting a narrow piece of tile, use a wooden guide to hold the tile from the other side. This way, the smaller piece won’t break or kick back.

Provide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:

","Install the diamond blade on your saw. Fill the reservoir on the bottom of the machine with cold, clean water. Adjust the fence on the saw to keep your cut straight.

"Studies show that regular exercise can help produce endorphins and increase neurotransmitters that may help with symptoms of depression. Try to exercise for approximately thirty minutes each day. A healthy diet can help you overall. In particular, omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to help as an adjunctive therapy for depression.  Omega-3- fatty acids are contained in foods such as kale, spinach, soybean or canola oil, flaxseeds, walnuts, and fatty fish such as salmon. They are also available over the counter, usually as fish oil gelatin capsules. Studies that showed benefit of omega-3 fatty acids in mood disorders included doses between 1-9 grams. However, more evidence supports the lower doses in that range. Sleep is often disturbed by depression. It is important to follow good sleep hygiene to ensure you are getting proper rest. Good sleep hygiene includes:  Going to bed and getting up the same time each day Avoiding stimulation before sleeping, such as exercise, watching TV, or doing computer work Avoiding alcohol and caffeine before bed Associating your bed with sleep as opposed to reading or doing other work There is not a consensus on how much exposure you need to help symptoms of depression. However, researchers agree some types of depression, such as seasonal affective disorder, may benefit from getting more exposure to sunlight. Research also suggests sunlight can affect your levels of serotonin.  Sunlight may also decrease the risk for disorientation and depression in older patients with Alzheimer's. Generally, there isn’t a maximum amount of exposure for sunlight. Make sure you do wear sunscreen if you are going to be in the sun longer than 15 minutes. Throughout the process, stay in touch with your doctor and let your doctor know about your status, feelings, or symptoms. Keep a relative or close friend involved as well. They may be able to provide emotional support or recognize signs of relapse. Having a good support system is very important. Try not to turn down invitations to activities, and try and get out more often. An analysis of different studies found that people who undergo psychotherapy while discontinuing an antidepressant are less likely to have a relapse. Psychotherapy is a way to help people with mental disorders by teaching them ways to deal with unhealthy thoughts and behaviors. It gives people tools and strategies to manage their stress, anxieties, thoughts, and behaviors. There are different types of psychotherapy. Treatment plans depend on the individual, the disorder, severity of disorder, and numerous other factors such as if you are on medications.  Cognitive behavioral therapy’s (CBT) goal is help a person think more positively and influence behavior. It focuses on current problems and solutions to those problems. A therapist helps the person identify unhelpful thinking and change inaccurate beliefs, thus aiding a change in behavior. CBT is particularly effective for depression. Other therapies—such as interpersonal therapy, which focuses on improving communication patterns; family-focused therapy, which helps by resolving family conflicts that may be influencing the patient’s illness; or psychodynamic therapy, which focuses on helping people gain self-awareness—are also available options. Some studies have shown benefits of acupuncture for depression. Although it is not part of guideline recommendations, acupuncture can be useful for some. Acupuncture is a technique in which thin needles are inserted through the skin to stimulate specific points on the body and relieve symptoms of diseases. If needles are sterilized properly there is little concern for risks. A Johns Hopkins analysis of previous studies suggests that thirty minutes of daily meditation may improve symptoms of depression and anxiety. Practical ways you can practice meditation are repeating a mantra, prayer, taking time to focus on breathing, or reflecting on what you have read. Aspects of medication include:  Focus - Focusing on a specific object, image, or breathing can free your mind of worry and stress. Relaxed breathing - Slow, deep, even paced breathing increases oxygen and helps you breathe more efficiently. Quiet setting - This is an important aspect to meditation, especially for beginners, so that you have fewer distractions.

"After you've told him your news, you should avoid being awkward about it. After your conversation, it's likely that you'll still see each other, so don't avoid him, blush, or try to run away if you see him. Just keep hanging out with your group of friends, and be nice when you see him. Don't make things more awkward by telling everyone what happened. If you're in the same group of friends, then everyone around you will be making things awkward too. Though you can eventually resume your friendship, you should take it easy for a little while. Remember that time you liked a guy who didn't like you back? Well, did you love hanging out with him after you found out the truth? Probably not. He may be hurting just by being around you, so try to cool it on the solo-friendship front.  You can still be nice if you see him in groups, but don't invite him out to movies, coffee dates, or whatever it is you used to do all the time every chance you get. Don't ignore him completely. You can invite him somewhere once in a while so he doesn't feel like you're avoiding him. But wait for him to initiate the friendship move. It may take time for you to go back to being friends with the guy after he revealed his feelings. But in many cases, this is completely doable, as long as there isn't too much water under the bridge. Give it a few weeks, or even a few months, and resume hanging out just like you used to. Who knows -- maybe you'll even be able to laugh about the situation one day, or find out that you're developing a crush on the guy two years down the road. Unfortunately, there are some cases where it's just not possible for you to return to your former friendship. The guy may feel too hurt or embarrassed, and being around you may only make him feel worse. If this is the case, then accept it and move on.

"If you have a favorite line from the Harry Potter books, you can easily use it to inspire your own Harry Potter themed mug. For this project, you will need a white mug, and a few Sharpies in varying colors.  Using a Sharpie, write your favorite quote from the books on the mug. Let the mug dry overnight before baking it for 30 minute at 350 degrees. Place the mug in the oven before it heats up and allow it to cool down in the oven before removing. Skip this step and you may find cracks in the mug. Possible quotes for your mug include: “I solemnly swear I am up to no good,” “Always” and “Felix Felicis.” Every year, Harry goes to Diagon Alley to stock up on potion supplies and you can make your own potion bottles in just a few easy steps. For this project, you will need miniature bottles, cardstock paper, decoupage glue, a magic marker and a rubber band.  Tear the cardstock into small pieces. On each piece, write a potion ingredient in magic marker (ideas include frog, dragon’s blood, tears, etc). Place a small amount of decoupage glue on the back of each cardstock label, then affix the labels to the bottles. Wrap a rubber band around the labeled bottle to help the glue set. Allow the bottles to dry, then play with them or display them as you wish. If you have a white t-shirt, some black paint and a paintbrush, you can create your own Harry Potter t-shirt featuring the Deathly Hallows.  Place a piece of cardboard in between the layers of the t-shirt. This will keep the paint from seeping through to the back. Paint the outline of a triangle on the t-shirt. The triangle should take up most of the space on the tee. If the triangle is not dark enough, go over it again with another coat of paint. Paint a line from the top of the triangle to the bottom of the triangle. Darken the line as needed. Draw a circle inside the triangle to complete the image of the Deathly Hallows. Darken the circle as needed. Allow the t-shirt to dry before wearing. If you prefer not to freehand the image, you can also look for a template online and use the template to create your painting. Harry Potter's owl, Hedwig, was one of his most loyal friends, and now you can easily make an owl friend of your own. For this project, you will need one small paper plate, two large paper plates, orange paper, two shades of brown paint, wiggle eyes, glue and a brown felt tip pen.  Paint the small plate and one of the large plates dark brown. Paint the other large plate light brown. Let the plates dry. After the plates have dried, draw a series of wavy lines across the light brown plate. These will serve as the owl's feathers. Cut the large dark brown plate in half. Glue the two halves of the dark brown plate diagonally over the light brown plate. The dark brown halves will serve as the owl's wings, and there should be an opening where you can see the light brown plate and the owl's feathers. Glue the small brown plate to the top of the wings to serve as the owl's head. Use the orange paper to cut out feet and a beak for your owl. Attach the feet to the bottom of your owl and the beak to your owl's face. Glue your wiggle eyes onto your owl's face and display your owl.

"This is so it can eat something familiar that its tummy is used to digesting. Make a gradual change over to the food you select, once the puppy has had one or two days to get used to its new home. To make this change add in a little of the new food (say ¼) and cut down on its previous diet (to ¾). Over 2 - 3 days further increase the amount of new food as you wean the puppy off the original diet. This gives the bugs in its tummy a chance to change over so that it doesn't get diarrhea because of a sudden change of food. Examine the label on the food packaging and check that a named meat, such as chicken, beef, or lamb, heads the list. This means the main ingredient is that named meat and is an indication of quality. Avoid foods which list cereals as the main ingredient and also ""meat-by-products,"" since these are the less nutritional parts. Once puppy is a year old switch it onto adult food. For a puppy under 12 weeks of age feed the recommended quantity of food (as per the pack instructions) divided into 4 meals spaced over the day. For a puppy aged 3 - 6 months divide his daily allowance into 3 meals. For six months or over feed 2 meals a day. Once the puppy is one year old you have the option of feeding it just once a day. Remember that beagles are exceptionally greedy. The beagle has no concept of when it is full, so don't give into that appealing expression and give it extra food. Also, make sure all food is kept out of reach and in a sealed container, because your puppy will relish the challenge of finding a way to break into a food bin. However, the good news is that beagles are highly motivated by food which gives you an excellent training tool. Be aware that after puppy has eaten, approximately 10 - 20 minutes later, it will get the urge to toilet. Put the puppy outside after a meal and remember to stay with it so that you are there to praise it when it goes. Or, just throw them in the dishwasher. Washing food bowls prevents illness, bacteria from growing, and it makes each mealtime more enjoyable.

"Pain that relates to a heart attack most often feels like a pressure, or squeezing, sensation. It can range from mildly painful, or not painful at all (in what are called ""silent heart attacks""), to full pain that people would rank a 10 out of 10 in intensity. The pain is often in the chest area, and may radiate down your left arm, to your jaw, or to your back. In addition to pain in your arm, jaw, neck, and back, there are other symptoms you may see during a cardiac episode, as well. These include:  Nausea Lightheadedness or dizziness Cold sweating Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing due to chest tightness If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms in conjunction with your pain, it is best to see a doctor as soon as possible to rule out the possibility of a heart attack. (911) if you are experiencing heart attack symptoms. If you are in doubt about your current condition, it is safer to call 9-1-1 or triple zero (000) or the Emergency Medical Services number for your area for quick transport to the hospital and further management. Always remember that if you have a heart attack, time is very important and not a second should be wasted because your life is at risk.  As you wait for emergency medical personnel to arrive, take 2 baby aspirins (180mg total) as these can diminish the severity of a heart attack. Aspirin works by preventing further blood clots, and it is a blood clot in one of the coronary arteries (the arteries surrounding the heart) that causes a heart attack to begin with (so aspirin helps to prevent this clot from getting worse). Do not take aspirin if you have been diagnosed with GI bleeds or allergies to aspirin. Also take nitroglycerin if you have it on you as you wait for the ambulance to get there. This can diminish chest pain and help you to cope with the symptoms until you get to the hospital (at which point the doctors can offer you additional pain medications such as morphine). DO NOT take nitroglycerin if you have had Viagra or Levitra in the past 24 hrs, or Cialis in the last 48 hrs. It can cause a dangerous loss of blood pressure and other complications. Tell your EMS workers and doctor if you have taken these medications in this time frame. If you suspect you may be having a heart attack, your doctor will perform a number of tests in order to determine and to confirm the diagnosis. You will receive an electrocardiogram (an ECG) to evaluate your heart's rhythm; abnormalities will show up in the case of a heart attack. You will also receive blood tests, mainly to check for an elevation of cardiac enzymes in the blood stream which is indicative of strain on the heart. Depending upon your symptoms and how clear the diagnosis is to your doctors, you may or may not receive additional diagnostic tests including: an echocardiogram, a chest x-ray, an angiogram, and/or an exercise stress test.

"If you’re really feeling overwhelmed and feeling like there just aren’t enough hours in a day for you to get everything done, then consider getting a job where you can work from home or have more flexible hours. Though you will have to work just as hard at home, you will have the luxury of avoiding a long commute and you may be able to find more flexible hours that fit your schedule.  Working from home isn’t for everybody. You have to be hardworking and self-motivated to be able to take the work seriously. Maybe working a 70-hour-a-week job just isn’t the thing you want. Maybe you want to switch career paths all together. Maybe your relationship isn’t bringing you satisfaction anymore but it’s sucking up all of your time. Maybe you love your job, but the 2-hour commute a day is killing you and you may need to move. Take a look at the big picture and see if there are any major changes you can make that can help you feel in control. That’s right. Stop doing things because your mother/best friend/co-worker/neighbor really need you to do them. Do them because it’s what you want to do to make your life feel meaningful and manageable. Commit to yourself before you commit to anyone else and make sure you don’t overbook yourself just to fit someone else’s needs. It’s important to learn to say no to people and to stop feeling guilty about it. If you say yes to everyone else, you’ll always be saying no to yourself. Do you really love photography, writing, interior decorating, or cooking? It’s a pretty radical step, but see if you can actually make money doing it, if not making a full living out of it. It may seem like a stretch, but if you have the talent and are willing to put in more time to pursue your dreams, then imagine how rewarded you’ll feel when you get to spend more time doing what you love and to make money from doing it. You may be feeling overwhelmed because you’re trying to make time to succeed in a career you don’t really care about as well as make time for pursuing your passion. This is a great way to change that. At the beginning of your week, start tracking how you spend every hour of your life. Be honest: if you spent half an hour texting your BFF or deciding what to wear, write it down. If you wasted forty-five minutes gossiping over gchat, write it down. At the end of the week, take a look at what you’ve done with your time and see where you can be more efficient, which things you can cut out, and what you’d like to do more. Then, create a “dream week” for yourself and try to follow it the following week.  You may find that you spent a total of two hours emailing people. Can you cut that down to one hour and make an extra hour for exercise? If you see that you’ve spent sixty hours doing work, it may be time to think about taking down your hours. ” In the classic time management book, How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life, by Alan Lakein, he asks his readers this very important question. It’s a simple question, but it’s very effective in making you see what you should really be doing – instead of what someone else thinks you should be doing – to get the most done and to feel the most in control of your day. The next time you feel overwhelmed, take a minute to breathe and ask yourself this question, and you may be surprised by what you discover.

"When you show your parents your pet, you'll want to put its best face forward. If possible, give your pet a bath. Clean out their cage, and wash their bedding. Make sure that their room is tidy. If your parents see that the animal is well cared for, they may be more likely to let you keep it. Just in case your parents say no, make sure you have your back-up plan all set. Find a friend or relative who is willing to take your pet for you. Offer them all of the necessary pet supplies. Avoid taking your pets to a shelter unless you have no other option. You want to make sure you appear mature and collected when you show your parents your pet. Since this can be an emotional topic, write down what you want to tell them. Try saying it in front of the mirror a few times. The best time to talk to your parents is at home when no one is distracted. Tell your parents that you want to talk, and ask them to sit down with you. Do not tell them as they are driving, cooking, or cleaning. You may be able to talk with them over dinner. Be careful about approaching them right after they get home from work. They may be tired and stressed out. Wait for them to relax before you talk to them. Be honest and straightforward. Let them know how well you have taken care of the pet. If they haven't noticed, point out that the pet is not as noisy or smelly as they may have thought. Acknowledge that you broke the rules, and apologize for it. Ask them if you can keep the pet. Promise to take care of the pet yourself.  For example, you can say,  ""I found a cat that needed a home. For the last two weeks, I have cared for the cat in my bedroom. She is very sweet, and I have taken care of her all by myself. I hope to continue caring for her. I know I have broken your trust, but please, can I keep her?"" If your parents say no, you have to live with consequences. Give the pet to another home along with all of their bedding, toys, and food. You may be grounded or punished. Bring your pet out to show them. Let them hold and touch your pet.

"Older bodies have a harder time regulating blood pressure than younger bodies.  Some people develop hypotension as they age.  If you are experience regular bouts of fainting or dizziness, or feel lightheaded often, consult a doctor about your symptoms. As people age, they are often placed on various medications to manage conditions they may develop over their lifetime. Sometimes weight loss can necessitate a need to adjust or discontinue your medication. Keep an up to date list of all your medications on you at all times, like in your purse or wallet. During pregnancy, a woman’s circulatory system changes.  These changes can lead to a drop in blood pressure.  While blood pressure usually returns to normal after pregnancy, you should stay aware of whether or not your blood pressure is changing during pregnancy and check it after giving birth to ensure it has returned to normal. Endocrine conditions including low blood sugar, diabetes, Addison’s disease, and thyroid disorders can lead to hypotension.  Parkinson’s disease and other central nervous system disorders can also lower your blood pressure.  Serious infections or pulmonary embolism, similarly, can reduce your blood pressure.   With this information in mind, your doctor will be able to prescribe medications and courses of treatment which will not lead to low blood pressure. Many medications result in lowered blood pressure as either a side or primary effect of the pill.  High blood pressure medicines like calcium channel blockers, nitrates, beta blockers, and diuretics, for instance, can lower your blood pressure beyond where it should be.  If your medication is causing your blood pressure to drop excessively low and you experience fainting or lightheadedness, talk to your doctor about alternative medications which might not have the same effect.

Provide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:

",Monitor your blood pressure regularly as you age. Keep an eye on your blood pressure if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you suffer from an illness or pre-existing condition. Take care when using medication.
"It will be made of metal or plastic and should lay flat against her sternum. Most women wear bras that fasten in the back, so check her back before you try to unclasp the front of her bra.  Though it's probably obvious what you're doing, make sure she's okay with what you are about to do. It doesn't have to be a big deal and can even be kind of sexy. Just pause and whisper ""Is this okay?"" If she tells you yes then you can proceed. If she says no, don't try to force anything. Just remove your hand and enjoy kissing her. This relieves some of the tension in the bra. If it is not an eyelet closure, there may just be two metal or plastic pieces that snap together and lock when flat against her chest. If this appears to be the case, spread your fingers so they are on either side of the clasp. If the bra is fastened with a hook and eyelet, then you will make the same snapping, squeezing movement as you would with a back-fastening bra. If not, you will need to push one side of the clasp up so that it unfastens from the other side. Pinch one side of the clasp between your thumb and index finger and pull up while your middle finger pulls down on the opposite side of the clasp. The hook is not always on the same side, so if this doesn't work, try pressing your thumb against your middle finger and pulling up while your index finger pulls down.

"that your rabbit can enter or leave at will. This doesn't mean that you have to leave the hutch open all the time. However, when the hutch is open, the rabbit should be able to go in and out without you having to pick it up. Look for a hutch with a door in front instead of (or in addition to) a hinged or removable top. This will allow your rabbit to hop in and out comfortably without your assistance. If your rabbit lives in cramped conditions, it will feel stressed and trapped. Select a hutch where your rabbit can stretch out in all directions and stand up on its hind legs without its ears touching the top.  At minimum, your rabbit should be able to take 3 hops from one end of the enclosure to the other. Ideally, the hutch should be either permanently attached to a larger exercise run or placed in a room where the rabbit can go out and explore safely at any time. This could be something as simple as a cardboard box or a paper bag that your rabbit can retreat into. If your rabbit has no place to hide out when it's feeling scared, tired, or insecure, it will begin to feel stressed out and frightened all the time. If you have more than one rabbit, you should have at least one hiding place per rabbit. Your rabbit will feel safest in an area that is quiet, well-ventilated, and neither too hot nor too cold. Keep your rabbit in a place where it will not be disturbed by other pets, loud noises, or lots of foot traffic.  Your rabbit should be able to eat, drink, sleep, play, and explore without feeling like it is in danger from potential predators. Ideally, at least one side of the hutch or cage should face a wall. That way, your rabbit won't feel like it always has to watch its back.

"As soon as you know, or suspect, that your cat might be pregnant, you should take her to the vets to get her checked over. The vet will examiner her, check on how her pregnancy is advancing, and give you guidance about how to care for her during the pregnancy. If your cat has any pre-existing health condition, or is overweight, it is especially important to take her to the vet.  You will need to increase the amount of food you provide for her as the pregnancy progresses. Your vet can advise you on how to go about this in detail, but switching to kitten food in the third trimester is generally advised. The vet will be able to give you an estimate of the number of kittens your cat is expecting. It is possible that the vet will determine that the pregnancy could endanger your cat, and may decide that spaying her is the safest thing to do. It's essential that you provide a safe, warm and quiet area for her to give birth. You should have this birthing nest set up and ready to go at least a week before she is due. Introduce her to the nest early and make sure she knows about it. If she doesn't have a regular bed or box she likes to sleep in, just get a good sized cardboard box and put some warm blankets in it to make it comfortable.  Make sure you only use blankets you don't mind getting soiled. Don't use blankets that have a strong smell.  Place a litter tray near to be box, but not right next to it. Keep the box a couple of feet away. Ensure there is fresh water and food next to the box, but keep the bowls outside of the box. Once you have prepared the nest and the mother, you need to prepare yourself. Gather together all the supplies you might need if there are any problems with the birth. This way you can act quickly and provide the best possible care. Make sure you have plenty of clean and dry towels, which you might need to clean off the kittens. Get some cat-milk powder, and a kitten bottle, in case there is a problem with nursing.  Have a cat box ready to go in case you need to take her to vets in a hurry. Keep the phone number of your vet handy. If there is a problem call up your vet for advice on how to proceed. Once labour begins you should monitor the mother closely. Stay nearby, but don't get too close. Don't invade her personal space, but being in the same room will let her know you are around and can help reassure her. You should be aware of certain warning signs that could indicate a problem with the birth. Knowing these will help you react quickly, so you can contact your vet is there are complications. There could be a problem if:  Half an hour after abdominal contractions have started, no kittens have been born. Half an hour has gone by since the birth of a kitten, the contractions are continuing, but there is no indication of another kitten on the way. A kitten has become stuck halfway during birth. In this case you may be able to apply some gentle pressure to the kitten, but if it doesn't move easily and immediately, contact a vet straight away. There is a green or dark discharge from the mother before giving birth. If there is a discharge twelve hours after giving birth, contact your vet. A kitten has not suckled for three hours.

"Mark two holes at each end of the dowel, at 2” and 4”. Then drill through the holes using your 3/8"" bit. Sand the hole to remove any little burrs and clean up the drilling. If you like the natural wood tone, you can leave it or, you can stain the dowel if desired. Tie a large knot at one end of the 16’ rope, leaving about 3” of a tail beyond the knot. Using a lighter, you can also melt the end of the rope slightly to prevent fraying in the long-term.  Start threading the unknotted end through the dowel and canvas. Guide the down through the outer hole in the dowel and then up from the widest corner of one side of the canvas seat to the narrow corner at the top. Measure approximately 3 feet from your first knot, and tie another knot. Thread the rope up through the inner hole of the dowel so that the knot you just tied rests against the bottom of the dowel (the opposite side as the first knot). Start by threading it down through the 4” (or inside) hole on the other side of the dowel. Measure 3 feet from the loose end and tie a loose knot. This knot will rest against the bottom of the dowel. Thread the loose end of the rope down though the other canvas pocket, starting at the narrow end and emerging from the wider end. Guide it up through the last hole in the dowel. Measure 3” from the loose end and tie a knot, leaving a 3” tail. This knot will rest on the outside of the dowel. When finished, the knots should be positioned on the dowel. If the two lengths of rope hanging below the dowel are not even, adjust the knots as needed before pulling them tight. Find the center of the rope above the dowel and tie a knot with 8” to 10” of excess above it. Attach the spring link, and then your quick link to the excess rope above the knot. Screw the hanging hook into a ceiling beam or large tree branch that can support your weight, then hang the link from it.

"Though it may be tempting to squeeze a swollen whitehead or a prominent blackhead, squeezing, poking, and picking at them can cause the skin to become even more inflamed. This can also lead to an infection or scarring. Instead, make sure you wash the area well and apply skin care products that will work to treat and heal the blackheads or whiteheads Never use any sharp tools on your skin, even if it is advertised as a blackhead removal tool. This can lead to permanent damage to your skin that can be difficult to treat or that will require more intense skin care treatments to heal. To make sure you are removing dead skin cells from your skin, you should wash your face at least twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. Use a cleansing product that contains salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and glycolic acid to remove blackheads and whiteheads effectively. If you wear makeup every day, you should always wash your face well and remove all makeup products from your face before going to bed. This will prevent a buildup of dirt and dead skin cells on your skin and ensure you do not develop any blackheads or whiteheads during the night. As part of your daily skin routine, you may consider using a toner that contains salicylic acid after you have washed your face with a cleanser. Toner, usually applied with a cotton pad, can help to remove dead skin and dirt that can lead to the development of blackheads and whiteheads. If your skin is sensitive or allergic to salicylic acid, you can talk to your dermatologist about using a toner that contains benzoyl peroxide or glycolic acid. Choose an exfoliation product that contains salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or glycolic acid to help get rid of any clogged pores. Apply the exfoliator in circular motions to any areas that have blackheads and whiteheads, such as your nose, forehead and chin. Exfoliation will remove dead skin cells and encourage a newer, smoother skin surface. It will also help to prevent further breakouts and diminish blemishes and pigmentation spots from acne. Lots of commercial products can dry out your skin, especially if your skin is still trying to get used to the ingredients in the product. To prevent dryness or chapped skin, use a moisturizer that is oil-free and noncomedogenic. This will ensure the moisturizer does not clog your pores or irritate your skin. Avoid using moisturizers that are heavy in oils, such as Vaseline and mineral oils. These products will only increase the buildup of oil and debris on your skin and the development of more blackheads and whiteheads.

"An English Master's Thesis has different requirements and employs different formats than a Master's Thesis in Chemistry. There are two types of Master's theses:  Qualitative. This type of thesis involves completing a project that is exploratory, analytical, or creative in some way. Usually, students in the humanities will complete this kind of thesis. Quantitative. This type of thesis involves conducting experiments, measuring data, and recording results. Students in the sciences usually complete this kind of thesis. Prepare a clear statement of the central thesis question that you intend to answer with your research. Being able to state your thesis explicitly and clearly is important. If you struggle with stating the question, you might need to rethink your project altogether. The outline will be beneficial to you to ""see where you're going"" as you move forward in your project, but also to give your committee members an idea of what you want to accomplish and how you plan to do so. You should check with your university for the exact requirements, which are often strict and institutionally specific. However, most Master's theses should include the following:  Title page Signature page (with the completed signatures of your advising committee - usually attained at the defense, or after the project is deemed complete) Abstract - this is a short (one paragraph or so) description/summary of the work completed in your thesis Table of Contents (with page numbers) Introduction Body of paper Conclusion Works Cited or Bibliography Any necessary appendices or endnotes

"Some people seem to be more prone to developing strep infections than others.  If you have a history of strep infections, it is more likely that a new infection could also be strep. While 20%-30% of sore throats in children are due to strep throat, only 5%-15% of sore throat visits to the doctor by adults are due to strep throat. Elderly patients, as well as individuals with concurrent illness (such as the flu), are more susceptible to opportunistic infections. There is often a higher likelihood of strep throat when other family members have had strep throat in the past two weeks. Shared indoor living or play spaces such as schools, daycares, dormitories, and military barracks, are examples of environments that pose a potential for colonization of bacteria. While children are at higher risk for strep throat, babies under age 2 are much less likely to be infected with strep throat. However, they may not have the usual symptoms as older children and adults. They may have a fever, runny nose, or cough as well as a decreased appetite. Ask your doctor about your baby's risk of getting strep throat if you or another close contact has strep and they have a fever or other symptoms. Immunocompromised individuals, those with the decreased ability to fight off infection, may be more at risk. Other infections or illnesses can also increase the chances that you have strep.  Your immune system may be compromised simply due to fatigue.  States of extreme exertion or exercise (such as running a marathon) can also tax your body. As your body focuses on recovery, it’s ability to fight infection may be impeded. Simply put, an exhausted body is focused on recovery and may not be able to defend itself as efficiently. Smoking can cause damage to your protective mucosa in the mouth and allow for easier colonization of bacteria. Oral Sex can expose your oral cavity to be more directly exposed to bacteria. Diabetes decreases the ability of your body to fight infection.

Provide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:

",Examine your medical history. Assess whether your age makes it likely that you have contracted strep throat. Figure out if your living situation increases your risk of strep throat. Assess whether you have any health risk factors that might make more susceptible to strep throat.
"This type of communication is called “integrative communication” and involves discussing issues openly and in a non-threatening way to reach mutual understanding, or “integration.” Integrative techniques have been shown to have long-term positive effects on relationships. For example, if the person you hurt tries to bring up a pattern of past behavior that they believe is related to your mistake, allow him/her to finish. Pause before you respond. Consider the person’s statements, and try to see the situation from the other person’s perspective, even if you disagree. Don’t lash out, yell, or insult the other person. The nonverbal communication you give while apologizing is just as important as what you say, if not more so. Avoid hunching or slouching, as this could indicate that you are closed to the conversation.  Make eye contact while speaking and listening. Aim for at least 50% of the time while you are speaking, and at least 70% of the time while you are listening. Avoid crossing your arms. This is a sign that you feel defensive and are closed to the other person. Try to keep your face relaxed. You don’t have to force a smile, but if you feel a sour expression or grimace on your face, take a moment to relax those muscles. Use open palms rather than closed hands if you want to gesture. If the person is close to you and it’s appropriate, use touch to convey your emotions. A hug, or a gentle touch on the arm or hand, can communicate how much the other person means to you. Express your empathy toward the other person. Acknowledge the hurt or damage that you did. Acknowledge the other person’s feelings as real and valued.  Studies have shown that when apologies appear to be motivated by feelings of guilt or shame, they are more likely to be accepted by the hurt person. In contrast, apologies motivated by pity are less likely to be accepted, because they seem less sincere.  For example, you could begin an apology by saying “I deeply regret hurting your feelings yesterday. I feel terrible about causing you pain.” Be as specific as possible when you accept responsibility. Specific apologies are more likely to be meaningful to the other person, because they show that you have paid attention to the situation that hurt him/her.  Try to avoid overgeneralizing. Saying something like “I’m a terrible person” is not true, and it isn’t attentive to the specific behavior or situation that caused the hurt. Overgeneralizing makes addressing the issue seem impossible; you can’t fix being a “terrible person” as easily as you can fix “not paying attention to someone else’s needs.” For example, continue the apology by stating what, specifically, caused the hurt. “I deeply regret hurting your feelings yesterday. I feel terrible about causing you pain. I should never have snapped at you for picking me up late.” Apologies are likely to be most successful if you offer a suggestion about how you will do things differently in the future, or repair the hurt in some way.  Find the underlying problem, describe it to the person without pointing fingers at anyone else, and tell him or her what you intend to do to solve that problem so that you can avoid the mistake in the future.  For example, “I deeply regret hurting your feelings yesterday. I feel terrible about causing you pain. I should never have snapped at you for picking me up late. In the future, I will stop to think more carefully before I say things.” The other person may want to express their feelings to you. S/he may still be upset. S/he may have more questions for you. Do your best to stay calm and open.  If the other person is still upset with you, s/he may react in an unfavorable way. If the person yells or insults you, these negative feelings may prevent forgiveness from occurring. Either take a timeout or try to redirect the conversation to a more productive topic. To take a timeout, express your empathy for the other person and offer them the choice. Try to avoid seeming like you’re blaming the other person. For example, “I clearly hurt you, and it seems like you’re upset right now. Would it be helpful to take a brief timeout? I want to understand where you are coming from, but I want you to feel comfortable.” To redirect the conversation from negativity, try to learn specific behaviors that the other person wishes you had done instead of what you actually did. For example, if the other person says something like “You just never respect me!” you could respond by asking “What would help you feel that respect in the future?” or “What do you hope I would do differently next time?” Express your appreciation for the role that they play in your life, emphasizing that you do not want to jeopardize or damage the relationship. This is the time to briefly recount what has created and sustained the bond over time and tell loved ones that they are indeed loved. Describe what your life would be missing without their trust and their company. . If an apology is not accepted, thank the other person for hearing you out and leave the door open in case they want to talk about it later. For example, ""I understand you're still upset about it, but thank you for giving me the chance to apologize. If you ever change your mind, please give me a call."" Sometimes people want to forgive you, but they still need a little time to cool off. Remember, just because someone accepts your apology doesn't mean they've fully forgiven you. It can take time, maybe a long time, before the other person can completely let go and fully trust you again. There is little you can do to speed this process up, but there are endless ways to bog it down. If the person is truly important to you, it's worth it to give them the time and space they need to heal. Don't expect them to go right back to acting normally immediately. A true apology includes a solution, or expresses that you are willing to fix the problem. You promised to work towards solving the problem, and you have to carry out your promise in order for the apology to be sincere and complete. Otherwise, your apologies will lose their meaning, and trust may disappear beyond the point of no return. Check in with the other person occasionally. For example, after a few weeks or so have gone by, you could ask “I heard how my behavior a few weeks ago hurt you, and I’m really working to do better. How am I doing?”
