Other important terms to know when building your stairs include:  The pitch line, an imaginary line that runs from the lip of the bottom stair to the lip of the topmost step. The “pitch” of the stairs is the angle between the base of the stairs and the pitch line. The rise, which is the total height of your staircase from its base to the topmost step. The run of your stairs, which is the depth of your stair measured from the front of your staircase to its back. The stringers of your stairs are the side supports to either side of each step. The measurements for your stringers will be used in the creation of your concrete forms. First, you'll need to find the total rise of your stairs, which can be found by measuring the total height from the planned base to the higher level/floor you are building up to. Then:  Measure the run of the steps by finding the distance between the frontmost and backmost part of the stair. Find the width of your stairs by measuring the distance between the leftmost and rightmost bounds of your planned steps. You can do this by finding the rise (total height from the bottom level to the top level) of your stairs and dividing that number by the riser height (the height of each step). Standard risers are between 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm). The building code in some states sets the maximum riser height at 8.25\" (21 cm), but you should be sure to check your local building code to prevent building stairs that violate state code or local ordinances.  If this number comes out as a decimal, you must round up to the next whole number. If your stairs are built so the topmost tread is a step below the level/floor you are building up to, the number of treads you need will be 1 less than the number of risers. Otherwise, you will need an equal number of treads and risers. There are many online sites that offer simple step calculators to simplify this process. You should be able to find these through a general Internet search for a \"stair calculator.\" These calculators will help you determine the exact specifications of your steps, including the number of treads, height of each riser, stringer length, pitch line, and so on. Divide the total rise (height) of the entire staircase by the number of risers. Generally, you should round the riser height of your steps to the nearest 1/16 inch (1.6 mm). You may have to install brackets in the concrete when you pour, so determine if handrails are a necessity for your stairs. If the stairs are next to a wall, you can always attach a handrail to that.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Equip yourself with a stair-building vocabulary.

Knowing what category your selected potato variety falls under will tell you when to plant and harvest it.  Plant early varieties as early as March or April. They'll take between 75-90 days to mature for harvest. However, if you plant them too early, they could be damaged by frost. Plant mid-season potatoes from May to July. They'll take between 85-110 days to mature for harvest. Mid-season potatoes grow best in warmer climates and temperatures. Plant late season potatoes from July to August. They'll take between 120-135 days to mature for harvest. These potatoes usually tolerate winter temperatures and frost better than early varieties. The entire bottom of the pot should be covered. Lightly pat the soil down with your hands to make sure that it is firmly packed. If the soil is not solid enough, the potatoes will sink to the very bottom of the pot. Both the fiberglass screen and the pebble/stone layer should be fully covered and no longer visible after you add the soil. Use a scoop or spade to lightly sprinkle granular organic fertilizer on top of the first soil layer in the pot. The amount that you use will depend on the type of fertilizer that you buy and the size of your pot. Read the instructions on the fertilizer's package carefully and follow them directly.  Choose a fertilizer that is explicitly for container planting. An organic or vegetable-specific blend is even better. Once your potatoes are established, you'll want to feed them liquid fertilizer as often as every 2 weeks. Again, reference the fertilizer's package for instructions. Space the tubers at least 6 inches (15 cm) apart. Ensure that they are not touching one another or the edge of the pot. Do not overcrowd each pot by planting more than the recommended amount of seed potatoes.  When the potatoes are in position, press them gently into the soil and fertilizer mix. It's likely that your seed potatoes will have eyes all over their skin, so just position the side with the most eyes facing upwards. Use a spade to gently add more soil into the pot, creating an even layer. When you are finished, your seed potatoes will be completely hidden. Use your hands to gently pat down the soil, being careful not to crush your tubers by pressing too hard. Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to add even more growing medium. Use your best judgment and fill it up most of the way, but not all the way to the rim. You will add more soil as the potatoes grow, so account for this as you fill. Use a watering can or hose to slowly add water to the freshly planted pot. Try to cover all of the soil's exposed surface as you are watering. When water starts to flow out of the pot's bottom drainage holes, stop watering.  Potatoes do best with soil that is moist, but not soggy. Water-logged soil can actually lead to the growth of fungus.

Each layer of the tower will be made up of four basic squares, so each layer will use 20 popsicle sticks. The number of layers you want to make will determine how many total sticks you will need.  If you want five “floors” to your tower, you will need 100 popsicle sticks. To make your tower as sturdy as possible, use wood glue instead of the basic white tacky glue. Lay out four popsicle sticks in a square with the horizontal sticks on the bottom and the vertical sticks laying on top. You want the sticks to be evenly spaced apart so they make a perfect square. Using one popsicle stick as a measuring device, make sure each stick is one “popsicle stick width” from the edge.  Lay two sticks vertically side-by-side across the two horizontal sticks to get the proper spacing. To align the sticks together, use a straight edge such as a block of wood or a brick. Lift one end of a vertical stick and place a dab of glue underneath. Press the two sticks together. Repeat this with the other side of the popsicle stick and then two more times with the other vertical stick. At this point, you should have a basic four popsicle stick square glued together.  Take care to maintain the accuracy of the square. This will be important when gluing the “floors” of the tower together. Make each module as square and regular as possible. Use a heavy weight such as a brick or textbook and lay on top of the glued joints to keep them flat while the glue dries. If the square gets bumped out of alignment, simply move the sticks back into proper placement. If the sticks dry out of alignment, you can carefully cut them apart with a knife and re-glue them or just make a new square. Before continuing on to the next step, you want to let the glue dry. Follow the instructions listed on the bottle of glue you are using. The glue does not need to be completely dry, but you want to make sure it has set enough that the sticks will not move as you handle the square. Leave the square under the heavy weight for at least 15 minutes before moving onto the next step. Place a popsicle stick diagonally on the “inside” of the square. The “inside” means the brace will be between the two vertical sticks and glued to the horizontal sticks. Place a small dab of glue at each end and glue the brace in place. The brace is essential stabilizing the structure and allowing it to hold more weight.  Put weight on top of the whole piece and wait about 15 minutes for the brace to dry. Try to glue the brace in the same place on each square. Starting with four new sticks, lay them out in a square and glue them together. After letting the glue set, add the brace to finish.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": ". One of the most powerful ways to tune into what others are feeling is by actively listening. This skill helps you hear their message along with observing their body language and emotional expression. All of these elements should be considered in order to bring awareness about what others may be feeling. Demonstrate active listening by orienting towards the speaker, relaxing your arms and legs at your sides, making occasional eye contact, and letting them finish their message before responding. A great way to show you're listening and can recognize others' feelings is by summing up their message or restating it in different way. Look for key words and phrases that represent the speaker's intended message and restate them. Follow up by asking if you understood them correctly. This helps affirm the speaker, and provides them with an opportunity to clarify, if necessary. For instance, your partner might say, \"My mom never listens. She just tells me what she wants me to do without ever asking for my input. It's like I'm not even living my own life.\" You might respond by saying, \"It sounds like your mom is really controlling and doesn’t respect your opinions. Is that how it feels to you?\" and nonverbal cues. Sometimes, people clue you into what they may be feeling by holding their bodies a certain way, by making facial expressions, or by using gestures. Pay attention to these aspects of communication in order to fully decipher others' feelings. For example, if your friend has their arms crossed and a scowl on their face, they may be angry or frustrated. If their shoulders are slumped and their eyes watery, they may be sad. Sometimes when a person opens up to you, they just want to have their feelings acknowledged and validated. One way to let them know that their feelings are normal and valid is to talk about a time when you experienced similar feelings. For example, if a friend is venting to you about losing their job, you might say, “I felt really sad and adrift for a long time when I got laid off a couple years ago. But I eventually managed to find something even better with some help from a career counselor.” To listen effectively, you need to be aware of your own perceptions and how they color what you hear. Mindful self-awareness helps you separate your own experiences, feelings, beliefs, and biases from what others are saying.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Practice active and engaged listening Paraphrase or summarize what the speaker said.

If your dog is reluctant to exercise or lags behind on walks, he may be having trouble breathing. You may notice your French Bulldog pant heavily with his tongue lolling out.

If your French Bulldog is really struggling to breathe and is not getting enough oxygen, the membranes of his mouth and tongue will look blue or purple. Healthy membranes should appear pink. You may also see your dog drooling. This is because he is concentrating so hard on breathing that he doesn't want to take time out to swallow.

Using one or more of these hacks is usually fairly simple, but since there are so many hacks available, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to using them. In this section, we'll give a brief overview of how to get and use a hack. For more detailed information, consult the online resources for the hack you've chosen. One good source for Minecraft hacks is MCHacks.net. There are other fine hack sites, but MCHacks.net has a fairly easy-to-use interface and plenty of selections. On the hack site, browse the selection of available hacks and find one that appeals to you — usually, the features for each hack will be listed on the download page for the hack. Download the hack and locate it in your downloads folder. For example purposes, you may want to follow along with these steps by installing Nodus Hacked Client, which allows you to fly, auto-mine, move through walls, and more. Nodus is available for download here. Most hacks come in compressed \"zip\" files. In order to install your file, you need to use a program that can decompress and extract the files. This process is fairly easy — see our articles on Winzip and other extraction programs like 7Zip for more information. Note that the extraction process will not be identical for every hack. Always read the read-me or help file included with the download if you're not sure how to proceed. Usually, once you extract your hack, you want to move the hack folder into your Minecraft directory. Depending on the hack you've downloaded, this location can differ. Consult the read-me/help document that came with your hack for more information.  In the case of the Nodus Client, the precise file location you want to move the hack folder to differs based on your operating system:  Windows: %appdata%\\.minecraft\\versions  Mac: ~Library/ApplicationSupport/minecraft/versions  Linux: \\Home\\.minecraft\\versions Most hacks need to be enabled before you start playing the game. Some even require you to set up a new profile, so, as always, use the help resources that came with your hack to guide you.  To play with Nodus, follow these steps:  Open the Minecraft launcher Select \"New Profile\" Set your profile name to \"Nodus 2.0\" and your version to \"release Nodus\" Save your profile Select your new profile and click \"Play\" Whenever you're using hacks, it's important to remember that not everyone in the game will appreciate the fact that you are able to do things that they cannot. Many servers will even have strict \"no hacking\" rules. For this reason, you may want to restrict yourself to servers with lax rules that allow for hacks and other cheat. Using hacks in \"vanilla\" servers is a great way to earn the hatred of your fellow players and have your I.P. address banned. Never use hacks to intentionally screw up other players' projects or annoy them — this is called \"griefing\" and it's something most moderators will ban you for.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Visit a Minecraft Hack site.

You can use fresh wax or bits of old, recycled candles. Break it into small chunks so that it melts quicker. If you don't have a double boiler, insert a metal can or metal bowl into heavy saucepan and surround it with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water. The water should only sit in saucepan, not in the inner dish. Bring the water to a simmer but do not allow it to boil. As the wax melts, continue onto the next part of the process. Wrap the end of an all-cotton pipe cleaner around the side of a pencil or pen. Once pipe cleaner meets itself and slightly overlaps, twist the remainder up so that it runs parallel to the side of the pencil.  After shaping the pipe cleaner, slide it off the pencil. Note that all-cotton pipe cleaners are strongly recommended. Pipe cleaners made with synthetic fibers may not burn as well or as safely. Use side cutter pliers to trim the long end of the pipe cleaner. The finished wick should only have approximately 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) standing above the circular base.  After cutting the pipe cleaner, use needle-nose pliers to carefully twist the upright portion of the wick toward the center of the circle. This portion should still remain upright, but it needs to be fairly centered. If the upright portion of the wick is too heavy or off-centered, the distribution of weight won't be balanced and the wick may topple over instead of standing straight. Grab the trimmed pipe cleaner wick using long-handled tweezers and carefully lower it into the melted wax. Let the wick soak in the wax for several seconds.  Work very carefully. Melted wax can cause terrible burns if it splashes or drips onto your skin. Make sure that the entire wick gets submerged in the melted wax. Do not release it from your tweezers, though, since it will be difficult to fish out if you do let go of it. Remove the wick from the wax and set it down on a sheet of aluminum foil. Wait several minutes for the wax to dry and harden.  Stand the wick on its circular base as it dries. When ready, the wax on the wick should be hard and cool enough to touch. Repeat the dipping and drying procedure one to three times, letting the wax harden in between coats. You need to build a thick, consistent coating of wax on the outside of the wick. The wax will allow the wick to catch fire more quickly and burn for a longer period of time. Once the wick is completely dry after the last coating of wax, it's done and ready to add to the top of a solid wick-less candle. When you light the wick, the flame should spread heat throughout the entire wick, sending it into the candle beneath it.

Ask yourself the following questions:  Am I willing to support a healthy environment for toads to help get rid of insects in my yard? Can I commit to taking care of my toad for its life, knowing that it could be up to 15 years? Can I afford the supplies and food?  Am I prepared to humanely euthanize invasive toads on my property? Is this better left to a professional? You can easily trap toads on your property or in other wilderness areas. Having your materials ready can help you quickly build your trap and look for toads. Get the following items:  24 ft. of 18-inch wide aluminum window screening or 15 ft. of 28-inch wide screening 15 ft. of 36-inch wide fiberglass screening 25 ft. of string or small rope to make handles Utility knife and scissors Stapler with 1000 staples  Small fish net or other container if you prefer to catch toads with your hands  Glow stick or outdoor light, that can attract insects toads like to eat. A 12 volt black light insect tube may be the most effective at attracting insects. You can purchase traps for amphibians, including toads. But they might not work as well as a trap you make. Using your materials, build the trap(s) and place where toads live.  Cut the aluminum window or fiberglass screening in a large rectangle. Then roll it into a cylinder that is 18” x 8” around. Make a 1” lip at the top by rolling the 18” end toward the other end. Staple the lip where it meets the cylinder screening. This will keep the cylinder and lip together. Staple every ½” to hold the cylinders together. Place the light or glow stick at one end of the of the cylinder and cover it with shade cloth or plastic. Leave the other end open for toads to enter the trap. The most effective place to put your traps is near a body of water. If it is winter, when some toads hibernate, then place the traps near refuges such as plant beds.  Place the trap near non-flowing, water source like a swamp, pond, or vernal pool in the summer and spring.  Put the trap near burrows and wooded areas in the late spring and early summer. Check to see if you’ve trapped any toads within 24 hours of setting the traps. If you didn’t catch any toads, keep checking the trap until you find a toad in it.  Use a plastic bag or jar with pinholes or a bucket of water to transfer your toad to its new home. Release other animals in the trap back into the wild. You may want to actively catch a toad using a net instead of traps. Look for the toads in the same places that you would place traps. Take a light or glow stick to attract the insects that toads eat.  Put on a pair of waterproof shoes or boots so that you can walk through mud or water. Sweep the net through the water, hoop first, through the water when you see a toad you’d like to catch. You’ll have to be quick so that you don’t miss it. There are many myths about toads giving humans warts by touching their skin. You can’t get warts by touching the skin of toads, but you may expose yourself to other irritants. Many toads have a so-called bufotoxin on their skin, which can cause other small animals death and irritation to human skin.

Be sure that you prepare a young child for the loud sounds and bumpy process of takeoff and landing, so that she does not become frightened. While you can't warn a young baby, you can try other methods of comfort, smiling and saying soothing words to let her know everything is alright. Giving your toddler, baby or child something to suck on is a good way to encourage swallowing. Have him swallow throughout the ascent and descent, or if he seems to be complaining that his ears are bothering him.  Nursing works great for young babies if you breastfeed. If not, try a pacifier or bottle. An older kid can drink through a sippy cup or a straw, or suck on a lollipop. The key is to get him to actively suck and swallow, so if he is old enough, teach him how to consciously do this in advance so that you can prompt him when it is time. While no one really knows why, yawning is socially contagious, so if your child sees you fake a yawn, she is likely to actually yawn in response. Yawning opens the Eustachian tubes in your child's ears, so that the pressure that has built up will equalize with the rest of the cabin. This is especially true if your child has experienced severe barotrauma in the past.  Young children generally should not be given decongestants, so if your child has a stuffy nose or sinus infection, it might be a good idea to reschedule your flight to avoid severe barotrauma.

When your hair freezes it can get brittle and frayed. You should also protect your hair from chemicals. Don't expose your hair to chlorine too often. When you go swimming, wear a swim cap. This is an important step for keeping your hair healthy. You should get a trim every 6 weeks, or as soon as your ends begin to split. Keeping your hair trimmed will make sure the ends don't split very far up the shaft.

The easiest way to identify them is to look for the worldwide recycling symbol, a triangle formed from three arrows with a number or letters to identify the type of plastic. Learn how to use this and other identification methods before selecting a glue.  PVC pipe is common in residential plumbing, although it should not be used for distribution lines or other high-temperature applications. It is usually white, or grey if used for electrical or industrial purposes. Its recycling symbol is 6 or PVC. CPVC pipe is PVC pipe treated to withstand higher temperatures. It has an identical recycling symbol (6 or PVC) but is usually tan or cream colored. ABS is an older and more flexible type of plastic piping, usually black in color. It is not suitable for drinking water purposes and in some regions may not be legal for any plumbing uses. Its recycling symbol is 9, ABS, or 7 (other). PEX pipe is the newest type of plastic piping, available in many colors. It is not recyclable. It cannot be glued, and must be attached using mechanical fitting tools. The material that bonds plastic piping together is called solvent cement. Find the specific solvent cement you need after you've identified the type of plastic.  ABS solvent cement will join two ABS pipes together. PVC solvent cement and CPVC solvent cement similarly join two pipes of that type. Transition solvent cement is used to join an ABS pipe to a PVC pipe. Its distinctive green color makes it easy to identify. If you can't find a more specialized product, universal solvent cement will do an okay job for any combination of PVC, CPVC, and ABS. You should still identify your pipe beforehand to rule out PEX pipe, which must be fitted instead of glued. Read the label of the solvent cement to make sure it will work on the size of pipe you're using. To attach a plastic pipe to a metal one, you may need a specific adhesive for that specific plastic and specific metal combination, or a mechanical fitting method.

Would you have made the same choices? When is the first big climax? Where is the monster first revealed? At what point do you start to see things from the villain's point of view?

When using a stallion to cover a mare, the owner of the stallion will want to know that the mare is clean and does not have any transmissible equine reproductive diseases. They will expect the mare to be swabbed prior to mating. This is done by a veterinarian who swabs the vagina, usually during a heat cycle.

Each estrus cycle takes around 21 days, with the mare being in estrus or 'heat' for an average of 6 days in every 21. She ovulates and is therefore most likely to get pregnant one to two days before the end of the heat, but this does vary with individuals.  For the maximum chance of conception ideally the mare would be covered by a stallion on day 2 or 3 after the beginning of heat, and continue on alternate days until the heat finishes. It can be tricky to know when a mare is coming into season. Some stud farms employ the use of \"teaser\" stallions who the mare can see but not reach.

However, the cost in other potential health problems (including even childhood diabetes or heart disease) outweighs any small benefits.  Calorie-rich but nutrient-poor foods, such as sugary drinks, are not the answer to healthy weight gain.  Foods that are rich in both calories and nutrients are the best option, because they help add weight and provide essential vitamins and minerals. Don’t tell your child he or she needs to “fatten up” or “get some meat on those bones” — say that you both need to choose and eat more healthy foods. Variety is important not only because it offers the best range of vital nutrients, but also because it helps keep mealtime interesting.  If mealtime is a chore or a bore, it will be more difficult to get your kid to want to eat.  A high-calorie, high-nutrient diet for weight gain in children should include starchy carbohydrates (pastas, breads, cereals); at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily; proteins (meat, fish, eggs, beans); and dairy products (milk, cheese, etc.). All children under two should consume full-fat dairy products, and your child’s doctor may recommend continuing this practice past that age to support weight gain. While fiber is important to a healthy diet, you may not want to overdo it with children trying to gain weight.  Too much whole grain pasta or brown rice can leave a child feeling too full for too long. We tend to think of fat as bad, but that is not always the case.  Many plant-based fats in particular are necessary components of a healthy diet.  Healthy fats are also ideal for weight gain because they provide about nine calories per gram, as opposed to about four per gram for carbohydrates or proteins.  Flaxseed oil and coconut oil are good choices and can be added to a wide variety of foods.  Flaxseed oil has a neutral flavor that can go unnoticed, while coconut oil can add a pleasant sweetness to everything from sauteed vegetables to smoothies. Olives and olive oil are another good choice. Nuts and seeds, like almonds and pistachios, provide ample amounts of healthy fats. Avocados can provide a creamy texture to a range of foods and offer beneficial fats at the same time. Children who need to gain weight should be offered regular snacks.  But, as with meals, healthy options should be chosen over empty-calorie foods.  Focus on high-calorie, high-nutrition, easy to prepare and serve snack options.  For instance, try peanut butter and jelly on whole-grain bread; nuts and dried fruit; apples with cheese; or a turkey wrap with avocado. For treats, present options like bran muffins, granola bars, and yogurt before resorting to cakes, cookies, and ice cream. Adequate water intake is important for children, but drinking too much can be filling and reduce the amount of food kids eat.  Empty-calorie drinks like soda provide no nutritional value, while the amount of sugar in fruit juices can be bad for teeth and overall health when consumed in excess. Water is always a good choice, but children who need to gain weight may benefit from drinking whole milk, smoothies or shakes, or even nutritional supplement drinks such as PediaSure or Ensure.  Talk to your child’s pediatrician about the best options. Have your child drink most of his or her beverage after the meal.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "A hands-free leash is a leash that has a belt, instead of a loop, at the end.  You wear the belt around your waist with your dog’s leash attached to the belt.  In general the process for walking your dog is the same. There are two great benefits for using a hands-free leash.  One is the obvious, you’re hands are free.  This makes it easier to reward your dog for good behaviour, and swing your arms if you’re walking quickly or running.  Two is that the main point of resistance to your dog is the middle of your body, right near your centre of gravity.  This makes you significantly more stable than holding the leash in your hands. When you go to the pet store to buy a leash, you’ll notice they come in every material, length and colour you can imagine.  The colour you choose is completely up to you!  The length should be based on the type of activity you’ll be performing with your dog.  And the material should be based on personal comfort and expense.  If you’re taking your dog for a loose leash walk, a leash that has the ability to uncoil and recoil is very useful.  Instead of folding pieces of the leash in your hands, you can simply click a button and allow your dog to uncoil the rope.  These leashes, however, are not designed for heel walks, or walks where there are a lot of obstacles for a rope to get caught on (including people and other dogs). Leashes can be made of metal chains, leather or nylon.  Here are some things you may want to consider when choose the material of a leash:  Metal - looks cool, but is heavy.  Can prevent a dog from attempting to bite the leash. Leather - expensive, but easy to hold and use.  The leather may not be as flexible in cold weather. Nylon - the least expensive, and has the most variety.  Stands up after constant exposure to different weather conditions.  But can be hard on the hands. Many dog owners enjoy bringing their dogs when going for a run, a bike ride, or rollerblading.  This offers great exercise to both you and your dog, and should hopefully tire your dog out faster! Remember to control your dog throughout the run.  Since it is a run, don’t allow your dog to stop unless you do.  You both should be able to maintain the same, steady pace. Your dog should have more slack on the leash while walking, than while standing still.  They should always feel comfortable in their leash and collar to avoid injury and misbehaviour.  When walking, your dog should be immediately to your side (which side will depend on what’s more comfortable to you).  Your dog should not walk behind or in front of you. If you allow your dog to walk behind you on a leash, there’s a great chance you’ll pull too hard on the leash in order to force the dog to keep up with you. Your right hand should be holding the end of the leash, with your thumb through the loop and excess leash folded in your hand.  Your left hand should be holding another section of the leash, closer to your dog.  Your left hand should be down near your left thigh.  When it’s time to stop, simply pull backwards with your left hand.  There should be some slack in the leash between your two hands AND between your left hand and your dog. When you’re ready to move again, start walking forward.  Your left arm will naturally pull on the leash and signal your dog it’s time to go.  Don’t yank on the leash. One of the worst situations most owners encounter when taking their dog for a walk is what happens when another person or another dog walk by.  You dog may walk perfectly if there’s no one around, but the moment there’s a distraction, your dog may completely forget everything they've learned.  That’s why it’s important to train your dog to ignore distractions while on a walk.  When practicing, use a friend or family member as the distraction, rather than practicing on unsuspecting strangers. While learning to ignore distractions, you may find the use of a head halter beneficial.  A head halter has a nylon strap that goes around your dog’s snout.  And the leash connects to the halter under your dog’s chin.  Both of these added features provide you with more control of what your dog is looking at.  Teaching your dog to ignore a distraction has a lot to do with making your dog pay attention to you, and only you.  There are several methods you can teach your dog: Avoidance - Sometimes the problem isn’t your dog, but maybe the dog coming in the opposite direction.  Instead of walking past the oncoming dog, train your dog to reverse directions. The L Pattern - The L pattern method can be used to position your dog off to the side of the path you’re on, facing away from the path.  If you see something distracting coming towards you, turn your dog to the left or right.  Walk your dog just off the path and use the sit command.  Keep your dog sitting there - looking at you - until the distraction has gone by. Repeated Sits - When you see a distraction coming towards, regardless of whether they’ll pass on your left or right side, repeated sit trains your dog to sit and face you.  Your dog remains sitting until the distraction has passed.  Depending on the situation, you can train your dog to sit facing away from the oncoming distraction, or facing the distraction with their head tilted away, looking at you. Speed Up - Most methods require that you stop your dog while the distraction is near, and wait to resume your walk after the distraction has passed.  An alternative is to simply pick up the pace when the distraction approaches, and slow down again after the distraction passes.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Use a hands-free leash.

Try to think of a time when you did feel confident and self-assured and recreate that moment in your head. Or, imagine yourself succeeding at something that you hope to achieve. You can repeat this process any time that you need a boost of confidence. Make sure that you imagine yourself succeeding with as much detail as possible. How do you look? Who else is there? How do you feel? What do you say? The way that you carry yourself can make a big difference in how confident you feel. Try to stand up as straight as you can and maintain good posture when you walk as well. To maintain good posture, it might help you to imagine that you are balancing something on your head as you walk. The way you feel about how you look can affect your confidence, so dress in clothes that make you feel good about your appearance.  Choose clothes that fit well, flatter your body, and are of good quality. Try to dress in clothes that suit the occasion as well. For example, if you are going to a job interview, then a suit or wear-to-work dress would make you feel more confident than a t-shirt and jeans. Focusing on the good parts of your life can help you to feel more confident and happy as well. Take a few minutes each day to write down something that went well for you. For example, you might write down a recent accomplishment and the skills that you’ve used to deal with hard situations. It might help you to make a list of all of your achievements, even ones that you may consider minor. People who lack self-confidence often focus more on failures than accomplishments, so it might be helpful to force yourself to look at the positives sometimes. Think about why you are proud of these accomplishments as well. Identifying the reasons why some things make you feel proud may help you to feel proud when you have other similar accomplishments. Telling others about something that you did that made you feel proud is a healthy way to show your pride and gain support from others as well. Taking a moment to share your accomplishments now and then will make you feel better about yourself and may help to take your mind off of what other people might think of you. For example, you could post a photo of yourself holding an award that you received for your grades or tell your friends at the gym that you improved your mile time. Try to treat yourself with kindness rather than beating yourself up all of the time. For example, if you have a presentation coming up that has you worried, don’t tell yourself things like “I am going fail.”  Instead, tell yourself something like, “This is going to be difficult, but I know that I can handle it.” Also, remember that you are probably much tougher on yourself than you need to be. For example, you may beat yourself up for losing your place during a presentation, but your peers won’t care and may not even have noticed. Remember that it is important to forgive yourself when you make a mistake. Refusing to forgive yourself can interfere with your ability to be proud of yourself, so try to forgive yourself as soon as possible. For example, rather than blaming yourself, try to tell yourself something like, “I made a mistake, but that’s okay. I am still a smart, capable person.” To stay proud of yourself even when things do not go your way, you will need to get into the habit of encouraging yourself. If something does not go the way that you had planned, try to readjust your expectations and encourage yourself to do better next time. For example, if a school project does not get the grade that you hoped for, you might tell yourself something like, “My project wasn’t perfect but the other students still seemed interested and asked questions. That means that I met my basic goal.”\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Visualize yourself succeeding.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Your skin may start to look a little pink or inflamed while at the beach or park, but you'll likely see it and feel it to a much greater extent by the time your get home a few hours later. As such, as soon as you feel and see sunburned skin, apply a cool compress or take a cool bath or shower if much of your skin is inflamed. The cool temperature of the water will help combat inflammation and soothe the pain a little. Your skin will also absorb some water, which is important for sunburned skin due to its dehydration.  Soak for 15–20 minutes, making sure that the water is cool yet not too cold — adding ice to the bath may feel pretty good, but it can cause your system to go into shock. Immediately post-sunburn, do not use soap or scrub your skin — it can irritate the skin and/or further dry it out. Aloe vera gel is likely the most popular herbal remedy for sunburn and other causes of inflamed skin. Aloe vera has a tremendous ability to soothe sunburn and reduce the pain. Applying aloe vera multiple times per day for the first few days after a sunburn can make a significant impact on your skin and prevent much discomfort.  If you have an actual aloe plant in your garden, break off a leaf and apply the thick inner gel / juice directly to sunburned skin. Make sure you test a small area of your skin first, however — aloe allergies are fairly common. Alternatively, buy a bottle of pure aloe gel from a pharmacy. For best effects, place the gel in the refrigerator and apply it after it becomes cool. There is conflicting evidence as to whether aloe speeds up the healing process. In at least one study, it was actually shown to slow healing. . Oatmeal is another natural remedy for soothing sunburns. It works quickly to reduce inflammation and itchiness. In fact, oat extract has been shown in studies to have anti-inflammatory properties, which is helpful to soothe sunburned skin. As such, make a runny batch of oatmeal, cool it down for an hour or two in the fridge and then apply it directly to sunburned skin and let it dry. Rinse it off with cool water, but do so gently because oatmeal is also a mild exfoliant and you don't want to further irritate the skin.  Alternatively, buy some finely ground oatmeal (sold as colloidal oatmeal in drug stores) and mix it in liberally with cool water in the tub before taking a bath. You can make your own finely ground oatmeal by pulverizing a cup of instant or slow-cooking oatmeal in a blender, food processor or coffee grinder until it has a smooth, fine consistency. For smaller sunburned areas, place a handful of dry oatmeal in a square of gauze and soak it in cold water for a few minutes. Then apply the home-made compress to the burn for 20 minutes every couple of hours. Sunburned skin lacks the moisture of normal skin, so another way to soothe it and stimulate healing is to keep it well moisturized. After a cool shower or bath, lather generous amounts of moisturizing cream or lotion onto sunburned skin, which will help prevent water from evaporating. Repeat applications frequently throughout the day to make the eventual peeling and flaking less noticeable. Consider natural moisturizers that contain vitamins C and E, MSM, aloe vera, cucumber extract and/or calendula — all help to soothe and help repair damaged skin.  If the sunburn is particularly painful, consider applying some hydrocortisone cream. A low-dose (less than 1%) hydrocortisone cream is helpful for quickly reducing pain and swelling. Don't use creams that contain benzocaine or lidocaine — they can cause allergy in some people and make the sunburn worse. Furthermore, don't use butter, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), or other oil-based products on sunburned skin — they can trap the heat in your body, making your sunburn worse.  Sunburn pain tends to be worse between six to 48 hours after sun exposure. Another method of keeping your sunburned skin hydrated is to drink lots of fluids. For the duration of your sunburn (at least the initial few days), drink extra water, natural juice and/or uncaffeinated sports drinks so your body and skin can rehydrate and start to repair itself. Start with at least eight 8-oz beverages (preferably purified water) daily. Keep in mind that caffeine is a diuretic and stimulates more urination, so avoid coffee, black tea, soda pop and energy drinks during the initial stages of sunburn.  Because sunburn draws fluid to the skin's surface and away from the rest of the body, keep on the lookout symptoms of dehydration: dry mouth, excessive thirst, reduced urination, dark-colored urine, headache, dizziness and/or sleepiness. Small children are especially vulnerable to dehydration (they have a greater surface area of skin compared to their weight), so check with your doctor if they appear ill or are acting strange after getting sunburned. Inflammation and swelling is a significant problem with moderate-to-severe sunburn, so taking over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) soon after noticing the sun damage is another good strategy. NSAIDs reduce the swelling and redness that are characteristic of sunburn. Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve) and aspirin, but they tend to be hard on stomachs, so take them with food and limit their use to less than two weeks. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and other analgesics can help with the pain of sunburn, but they don't impact the inflammation and swelling.  Look for creams, lotions or gels that contain NSAIDs or pain relievers — this is a potentially quicker way to get relief from the medication. Keep in mind that aspirin should not be taken by children or teenagers under 18 due to the risk of Reye's Syndrome, a potentially fatal condition. Prevention is always your first line of defense against a sunburn. There are many things you can do to protect yourself from sunburn, including: wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher; reapplying sunscreen every two hours; wearing protective clothing made from tightly-woven fabrics, long-sleeved shirts, hats, sunglasses; avoiding extended exposure to the sun during peak hours (usually 10am – 4pm). Sunburn in a very light-skinned person may take less than 15 minutes of midday sun exposure, while a darker skinned person may tolerate the same exposure for hours.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Take a cool bath.

If there was ever a recipe that cream of mushroom made necessary, it is this.   To mix it up, mix together about 4 cups of cooked green beans, cut into bite-sized pieces, and one can of condensed cream of mushroom soup.  Stir in about a half cup of milk, a few dashes of soy sauce, to taste, and salt and pepper to taste.  Line the mixture in a greased casserole dish and bake at 350 F for about 20 minutes until it gets warmed through and bubbling. Top with about a cup of fried French onions and let them brown in the oven for about five minutes. Serve hot. Summer squash like yellow crookneck or zucchini have a tendency to be pretty bland on their own, but baked up with cheese and crunchy topping can take them to the next level.   Cut up about 4 cups of squash (roughly 2 medium squash) and sauté them over medium heat in some olive or coconut oil and half a chopped onion, then combine with ¾ of a cup of water, 2 beaten eggs, a cup of shredded cheddar cheese (or whatever kind of cheese you prefer), and salt and pepper to taste.  Mix the ingredients thoroughly and spread into a casserole dish. Top the mixture with crunched up cracker crumbs, or breadcrumbs if you prefer, dotted with a tablespoon of butter. Bake at 400 F for 20 minutes, or until golden and firm.  Additions or substitutions might include cherry tomatoes, fresh dill, basil, or other summer herbs, and bacon. The same recipe would also work for winter squash that had been par-baked, and would be great combined with other root vegetables like sweet potato and carrot. To liven up cruciferous vegetables, you can't go wrong with cheese. Thickened with a simple roux and baked under breadcrumbs, it's a delicious, if not super-healthy, way to eat your broccoli. Start by chopping a head of broccoli and about half a head of cauliflower into bite-sized pieces, or by defrosting a package of each, if you want to use the frozen variety.   Sautee half an onion over medium heat in butter, then add two tablespoons of flour to start the roux.  Stir vigorously, browning the flour, then add about two cups of milk, whisking to thicken. When it bubbles and gets thick, add a quarter-cup of parmesan cheese and a half a package (about 4 oz) of cream cheese.  Season with a teaspoon each of thyme, oregano, and dill. If you like a little kick, this works great with about a quarter teaspoon of cayenne, as well.  Toss the broccoli and cauliflower in the cheese mixture and spoon into a casserole dish. Top with breadcrumbs and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese, then bake at 350 F for about 40 minutes. A common complaint about vegetable casseroles is that the cheese and cream outweighs the nutritional benefits of the vegetables. While cream-of-mushroom and other varieties of cheesy casserole may taste good, there are perhaps more nutritional ways of preparing vegetables. Mixing quinoa--a perfect protein, as well as a delicious and hearty grain--with hearty roasted butternut squash fits the bill of healthy and tasty casserole.   Roast one medium-sized butternut squash at 400 F, after slicing it in half and scooping out the seeds. Drizzle a little olive oil on top of the squash and roast in a roasting pan for about 20 minutes, until soft. If you'd prefer chunks of squash, rather than mashed, you can peel the squash and chop it into bite-sized chunks before roasting.  In a hard-bottomed pot, sauté half an onion, chopped, with 2-3 cloves of minced garlic in olive oil. When the onion is translucent, add a teaspoon of dried sage, or a tablespoon of fresh chopped sage, and one cup of quinoa. Stir to coat the quinoa, then add a cup and a half of water.  Bring the quinoa to a boil, then simmer over medium-low heat, covered, for about fifteen minutes, until all the water is absorbed.

You can use reclaimed steel joists, or something like metal trusses, as these are adaptable and usually strong enough for the purpose. A welding tool is likely to be useful in attaching the bracket to the vehicle’s frame. Try to remove the motor deck and cutting tool before doing this, both for safety reasons and ease of access. You now need to attach the plough bucket or blade to the frame using a welding tool. Try to incorporate a pin or lever to allow the plough bucket to manoeuvre side to side. Add a hand-operated lever to the bucket so it can be pushed to manoeuvre it while you are sitting on the tractor. If you are left-handed, consider doing this on the left-hand side. If you want to incorporate a lift mechanism, you may need to modify the frame slightly to allow for this. You’ll probably need to create a hand or foot lever so the bucket can be lifted by the person riding the mower. Special garden equipment snow chains are available. Check the tire to see what the wheel size it (it should be written on the tire). Your local garden store may carry these, or you can purchase them online. Start fitting your snow chains by laying the chain out on the ground by the side of the tractor wheel. Remove any tangles and check for any damage. Drape the chain over the wheel. You’ll then need to move the tractor forward a few inches to wrap the chain around the tire. Finally, clip the chain into place and do up the rest of the fittings so it is securely fastened around the tire and tight enough to grip the snow as required. For stability, consider adding some weight onto the back end of your tractor to balance out the new weight at the front added by the snowplow blade.

It’s important that you set this feature up while you still have your phone with you, as there is no way to enable Find My Phone if your phone has already been stolen.   Find My Phone is a component of Apple’s cloud-based server, iCloud, which backs up and stores your phone’s data. If you have not yet set up an iCloud account, you won’t be able to use the Find My Phone app. Set up an iCloud account through your phone’s “Settings” menu, then locate “iCloud” and tap the “Account” to sign in.  In order for the Device Manager to locate your stolen phone, you’ll need to have the GPS-tracking “Location” setting turned on. You can turn Lost Mode on remotely: you’ll need to login to your iCloud or your Android Device Manager account, and can turn on Lost Mode from there. With Lost Mode turned on, whoever stole your phone will be unable to login and shouldn’t have access to any of your phone’s data or apps.  Once you’ve recovered your missing phone, you can turn off Lost Mode by entering your passcode on the phone’s home screen. Even if your iPhone or Android is offline (not connected to the internet), you can still remotely lock the phone. You’ll do this through logging in to your online account. Any settings that you change on your device will take effect the next time the phone is online. If your iPhone has been stolen, you can track its physical location online at www.icloud.com/find. This will bring up a map showing the current location of your phone. The map will show real-time movements, so if your phone is on a bus or subway car, you’ll be able to follow it along the map.  If your Android phone has been stolen—or you prefer to setup your account on a computer rather than on your phone—you can access the Device Manager online at: www.google.com/android/devicemanager. Logging into this website will show you your missing phone’s location.  Once you’ve located your missing phone, you can have the device play a sound to draw attention. While this won’t help if someone has deliberately taken your phone, it could be useful if your phone is near you and has simply been misplaced. From the iCloud or Android Device Manager website, you can click a button to Lock your phone. This will disable the login mechanism, and make it so that the individual who stole your phone will not have access to any of your personal data or contact information. The Device Manager will ask you to input a new device password for your phone. Once you have recovered your lost or stolen phone, you’ll be able to disable Lock mode by typing in this password. From the menu on the online phone tracking page, you can choose to “Ring” your phone. This will cause your phone to ring at its maximum volume for 5 minutes, unless you choose to turn off the Ring setting before that. The Ring function is useful if you suspect that someone may have taken your phone by accident or that the loud ringing will help you or another individual find your phone nearby. If you prefer not to use the Android Device Manager function to track your phone if it goes missing, you can also download one of many available tracking apps from the Google Play Store. These apps will allow you to connect to a website where, if your phone has been stolen, you can find the phone’s location remotely.

Recovering from a narcissistic relationship takes time. There is no precise window to allow for healing. Don’t add insult to injury by being hard on yourself for not healing fast enough. Recovery can take a long time. It's OK to heal at your own pace. A lot of emotions and mental processes may follow a breakup with a narcissist. Don’t fight off these emotions. Allow yourself to fully feel them. You might experience sadness, anger, and even shame for not seeing all the red flags about this person. Give yourself permission to grieve, but don't get lost in your grief. Instead, try  mindfulness by noticing your thoughts, labeling the feelings, and recognizing how they manifest in your body. Feel them and then let them go. Non-stop judgment and self-doubt may have been partly what made you attractive to the narcissist in the first place. In order to get over this person and minimize your chances of entering another similar relationship, you will need to stop judging yourself. Resist the urge to call yourself “stupid” or criticize your inability to see the narcissist’s true nature. Remember even if you “feel” stupid, it doesn’t mean you are. Feelings are not facts. A major part of recovery from a narcissistic relationship is self-care. When you were in the relationship with the narcissist, you may have felt like the person never truly supported you or cared for your emotional needs. Now is the time to feel that void by pouring all that love and support into yourself. Self-care can be anything that helps you feel relaxed and nourished. Try creating a routine of journaling, lighting a scented candle, and playing soft music. Or, pick up a new hobby, learn how to bake, or plant flowers in your garden. Do whatever makes you feel good. Many others have had to recover after dating or even marrying a narcissist. You can get through this by reaching out to them.

Raise that hand in front of the dog’s nose to let it get the scent, then to above its head level. When you hold the treat above the dog’s head, most dogs will naturally sit to get a better view of it.  Give the dog an immediate treat and praise. Follow the routine of treat and praise and say “good sit” when the dog is performing the behavior. Your pup may be slow at first, but more treats and praise will speed up its response. Make sure that you do not praise the dog until its actually sitting. If you praise halfway through the sit, the dog will think that is what you want. Also, make sure that you do not praise it for getting back up, or you will get that behavior instead of the sit. If your dog does not sit with the treat technique, you can use your leash and collar. Stand next to the dog, facing the same direction as it. Place a little backward pressure on the collar to encourage a sit. You may even need to encourage the sit by adding a little gentle scoop behind the dog’s hind legs. Gently lean the dog backward with the help of the collar while doing this. As soon as it sits, give the dog immediate praise and reward. Praise natural sitting behavior. Look for times throughout the day when your dog just sits on his own. Praise that behavior, and pretty soon you'll have a dog that sits for attention instead of jumping or barking at you. The “come” is used whenever you want your dog to come to you. This command is potentially life-saving, as it can prevent your dog from running off if he gets loose. Begin by getting your dog’s attention. You want to make it run toward you. Use praise and your “happy voice” to encourage the dog to move toward you. Once the dog comes, give immediate praise.  Pair the behavior with the verbal command. As your dog begins to realize it will be rewarded for coming to you, start giving the verbal command “come.” When it responds to the command, reinforce it in praise by pairing it with “good”: “good come!” Move the training to more public spaces. Because the “come” command could save your dog's life, it must learn to respond to it even when it's distracted. Move the training sessions from your home or yard to a public park. There are more sights, sounds, and smells demanding his attention there. Give enormous rewards. Because this command is so important, the praise you give for performing it should be extravagant. Responding to the \"come\" command should be the best part of your dog's day. Take your dog on regular walks with a leash. This is important not just for training, but for its physical and mental health. Depending on what breed of dog you have, the dog may need a lot of exercise to keep it happy and in shape.  Discourage pulling. Most dogs will pull on the leash when they're learning to take walks. When it starts pulling, stop immediately. Don't take another step until the dog comes to your side and focuses its attention on you. Change directions. An even more effective method is to walk in the opposite direction and encourage your dog to come with you. Once it has caught up, praise and treat it. Make it fun to be by your side. Your dog's natural impulse is to chart its own course and investigate its environment. You need to make walking by your side more appealing that that. Use an enthusiastic voice when changing directions, and lavish the dog with praise when it comes back to your side. Pair the behavior with a verbal command. Once the dog walks consistently at your side, you can give the behavior a name, like “heel\" or “let’s go.”\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Training a Doberman to sit.

Head to a hardware store or repurpose any wood scraps you have laying around. Pine and cedar are a couple of options for an inexpensive but effective trap. For an easy trap that doesn’t require a lot of cutting, get:  A 4 in × 4 in (10 cm × 10 cm) wood post at least 7 in (18 cm) in height. Pressure-treated wood often has a faint green hue and smells like oil. The wood may also have a stamp like “L P22” on it to indicate that it has been treated. You can design your trap differently if you wish to. For instance, if you’re good with crafts, try cutting boards and nailing them together to make a square box. Whenever you plan on cutting or drilling wood for the trap, cover up to avoid sawdust and wood shards. Keep other people out of the areas while you work. Consider also working outdoors or ventilating your workspace by opening nearby doors and windows. Wear a short-sleeved shirt so you don’t have to worry about loose fabric getting caught in your tools. Also, don’t wear jewelry and tie back your hair if it is long. If you’re working with a long post, trim it to size first. Measure up from one end of the post and mark the distance in pencil. Then, use a circular saw or handsaw to cut horizontally across the post. Set aside the part you aren’t planning on using for the trap.  The post doesn’t have to be very long in order to direct bees into the trap. In fact, leaving the post relatively small makes the trap easier to handle. If you have excess wood to spare, you could make additional traps with the material you cut. Measure about 7 in (18 cm) up along one side of the post. Make another mark about 4 in (10 cm) up the opposite side of the post. Use a ruler to draw a diagonal line connecting the points. The line will be at about a 45-degree angle and is used to cut the top part of the trap.  Making this angle helps later with creating tunnels for the bees to enter. You could also do it without cutting the post at an angle, but it makes the tunnels trickier to line up. If you don’t wish to do this, you could leave the top alone and instead make a tunnel all the way through the post. Then, cover the top hole with a plank so the bees can’t escape that way. Hold the post still again. To make the cutting process easier if you’re using a handsaw, pin it to a workbench or sawhorse with a bench clamp. If you’re using a circular saw, hold the wood so the saw slices across the line you made. This will leave the post with an angled top you can use to hang the trap later.  The angled top prevents light from filtering into the trap’s tunnels, so the bees won’t have as much of an opportunity to escape. If you don’t plan on cutting the top, try nailing a board to it. The board will cover up any holes as well as give you a place to safely install a hanging mechanism.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Purchase pressure-treated wood to make the base of the trap.

It will be easier to sew without it. You will be sewing a fabric band or cuff to make the jeans longer. First, however, you will need to draft the pattern for your cuff. Here is how to figure out the measurements for your cuff:  Measure around the cut edge of the pant leg (the circumference). Add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). You will need this for your seam allowance. Decide how wide you want the band to be. Multiply that number by 2 (you will be folding the fabric in half later) and add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for the seam allowance. You will end up with something that looks like a rectangle. You can use any fabric you want, but a lightweight fabric (such as cotton) may be easier to sew with than a heavyweight fabric (such as canvas). Choose something with a contrasting color.

Getting thoughts out in the open is also a good way to keep them from growing or festering in your head, and it can improve your sex life instead.  If you're sexually active, communicate with your partner to maintain a healthy and open sexual relationship that keeps you both fulfilled. Communication doesn’t have to be just verbal, either. You can write your partner notes. As a couple, you could also read a book together or watch a film that shows or articulates your thoughts. And if you’re reluctant to communicate with your partner about sex, remember that communication itself is a turn on.  If you’re not sexually active, it’s equally important to communicate. If you're thinking about sex more than you'd like to even though you're not sexually active, is it because there's something lacking or frustrating about your sex life? Talk to your partner openly and truthfully. You also want to make sure your expectations are aligned with your partners. You should know if and when, for example, your partner wants to begin having sex, and he should know when you want to have sex as well. If you are in a relationship, use your sexual drive to act in a loving and caring manner toward your partner. Be romantic instead of strictly sexual, per se. That way, you can build the emotional intimacy you share with each other. With masturbation, there's nothing to feel guilty about, especially if it helps keep your sexual thoughts and urges in check. Abstaining might even worsen your urges. If you're constantly thinking about finding a sexual partner, you can date regularly yet keep yourself partially sexually satisfied through masturbation. This can help free your mind to focus on more important things. Just make sure masturbation doesn't turn into a new addiction, however. Any topic that you think about too much or obsess over can seem all-consuming, and while sex is important and seems omnipresent, life is not entirely reduced to sex and sexual desires.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Obviously, don't be snarky to authority figures - that's just asking to get in trouble! However, being slightly aggressive and displaying a \"don't mess with me\" attitude will get the message across. Don't be arrogant, but act as though most people in general are below you, and as though your friends are the exception to that.  Don't be rude to people who don't know you. You shouldn't call someone an idiot just because they approached you and asked for directions. If the person is a stranger or barely an acquaintance, aim for being polite, but distant. Common ways of showing an edge are to be sarcastic and being rude in a backhanded way. A common trait among many tsunderes is that in an attempt to hide their feelings towards their love interest, they act even harsher towards them. They may play hard-to-get, which is a very common trait of tsunderes, and have a constant back-and-forth love-hate relationship. Imitate this! Give your crush some attitude (but not so much that they dislike you), and swap back and forth between love and hate. It's a classic trait of tsunderes.   If your crush likes someone else or has a partner, be especially harsh towards that person. Insulting them subtly is a great way of getting across your feelings without really revealing it. However, keep in mind that this can backfire if your crush finds out you were being cruel to the person they like. If your friends ask you if you like that person, give them a harsh reprimand (e.g. \"Idiot! As if I'd like [your crush's name]!\"). Whether you're with your crush or your friends, when there aren't others around, drop the attitude a bit and show your kinder, softer side. Don't totally drop the attitude, of course, but definitely tone it down a notch (or two, or three). Show them your sweet side - that's a side of you that they'll be wanting to see. Be nice in these moments, and they'll be wanting even more. If your friends or your crush are sensitive and don't like your cold side, take these private moments to apologize to them. Be sure to let them know that while you do actually care about them, you have a different approach to getting that across. Let them know that they have merit in your eyes, but be subtle (if not a bit backhanded). Tsunderes are well-known for managing to take on a snarky attitude towards anything at all, whether it's something small or big. Being passive-aggressive and seeming like everything is merely a minor annoyance is a good way to act tsundere. Backhanded compliments and snarky remarks are the way to go.  Classic passive-aggressive lines dropped by tsunderes are \"It's not like I [care about/like/think about] you or anything...\", \"I didn't do this for you! I did this because I wanted to!\", \"Idiot!\", and \"It's not like that!\". If you give someone a gift, a good comment to make is, \"I suppose I should give you something... But I guess you deserve it\". If you're upset about anything, play it off as anger or frustration, or take an aloof, I-don't-care kind of attitude. Outwardly, blame it on someone else (e.g. \"That teacher is so stupid.\"), and don't talk about how you feel to strangers. Remember, tsunderes are usually very barricaded by their rough, harsh exterior; you don't want to be an open book of emotions to people.  Of course, it's okay to have emotions; you're allowed to feel what you feel. Tsunderes just don't often show their vulnerable, more emotional side to strangers. If you need to cry, go to a close friend that you trust. For your own emotional health, don't actually blame someone else for something or refuse to ever talk about your emotions. If you know you're in the wrong, own up to it, and find someone you can vent to. Remember, if tsunderes don't show a kind side over time, they're no better than jerks. Tsunderes also really do value the people they feel deserve their time, so be nicer to people who spend a lot of time around you, such as your friendly acquaintances and your crush. It'll show them that you really do care about them, and that your attitude is nothing more than a façade or defense mechanism. when someone pushes your buttons. When tsunderes are provoked, they really take the bait, and react with a vengeance. If somebody bumps into you, a \"Hey, watch where you're going, you idiot!\" and fuming can have a great effect. And if somebody is rude to you or bullies you, react to it strongly - you're a tsundere, after all. Take it up a notch further than you already have!  Never physically attack someone. The constant hitting and attacking that you'd see in anime and manga would land you in police custody. A light slap on the upper arm might work with some people, though, as long as they don't mind play-punching. You're trying to be a tsundere, not verbally abusive towards anyone who says a word to you. Remember, tsunderes don't want to actually hurt people - they just want to take on an \"I can do this without you, better than you\" attitude. Don't bully or verbally attack people, especially if there's no justification for it. If you do, you'll just end up driving people away from you.  Never intentionally target someone's weak spots. If you know your friend or crush is sensitive about the fact that they're bad at socializing, don't attack their social skills. This can cause a serious hit to their self-esteem and will most likely drive them away from you. After all, who wants to be friends with a bully? An often-overlooked fact is that tsunderes do cause emotional pain at times, or overstep boundaries and attack things that others are sensitive about. In the real world, people will be much more vocal about you hurting their feelings than they will in anime or manga. If you do end up hurting someone, apologize immediately and back off. It's likely that all eyes will be on you, and you don't want to end up friendless. Tsunderes are capable of admitting they're in the wrong and being kind. After all, being a tsundere is all about revealing your kinder side to people.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Develop an edge out in public.

Here are some things to keep in mind in relation to specific race preparation:  If it's possible, try to run the circuit as a practice run before the event; knowing the race well is an important part of not being surprised and of knowing where you'll hit your pain barrier or meet other challenges. If it's too far away, run equivalent courses in your own area to get yourself ready. In addition, learn all that you can about the course. Check out the enrollment material, look at the relevant websites, and ask questions of other runners on cross country running forums. Taper off the training in the last two weeks. In the penultimate week, only do two hard runs. Focus on high quality running. In the last week, only do one hard run, about 3 to 4 days before the actual race.  Having lots of recovery periods in the lead-up to the race is extremely important. The day before the race should be an easy training day (running too hard will cause your legs to be too sore) and be sure to have at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep the night before the race. You've done your race preparation and you're ready to prove something to yourself. Keep in mind that the event is a culmination of all your hard work and  Prepare a snack bag and your water needs. Bring a banana to eat after a workout or race. The sugar in the banana will be quickly absorbed by your body, restoring your energy. Also, the potassium found in bananas will help prevent cramps. Turn up at least an hour before the race. This is even more important if you don't know the area, as you'll want to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the terrain and rules, etc., as well as signing in and meeting officials. Warm up. Do this at least 10 to 30 minutes prior to the race. Be sure that have plenty of time to stretch before you make your way to the starting line. Some people recommend running the first mile of the race hard and fast. The benefit of this is that you can run ahead and keep pace with the top ability level runners, and there will be less people in front of you. This is encouraging and prevents you from being boxed in.   On the other hand, other cross country runners prefer to run at their pace from the start, as running out fast can wear you out immediately and lose you time overall. It's absolutely vital to know your pace and race method before you turn up, although as a beginner, if you're prepared to experiment in the first few races, this can be a good time to find out what works best for you.

Utilize the experience you've gained training and your knowledge about yourself as a runner to run the race to the best of your abilities. When racing, don't worry about the times and the spectators.

Start with 15 lunges on both sides each day and try to work your way up. Make the exercise even harder by using your free hands to hold dumbbells. Like lunges, squats also work your butt, thighs and core. Start with your feet shoulder width apart, with your toes slightly turned out. Lower your body down towards the floor until your thighs are at a 90 degree angle to the floor.  Keep your torso upright and look straight in front of you. Return to your starting position by straightening your legs and keeping your weight equally spread between the balls and heels of your feet. Use each of your hands to hold a dumbbell at your sides. Start by doing one minute of squats each day, then work your way up. This exercise is helpful in strengthening your butt, hamstrings and lower back. To start, lie on your back on the floor.

It works by conditioning the dog to get closer and closer to things it fears by luring it close with something it loves. For example, if your dog is afraid of bicycles, you place your dogs favorite toy or a treat close to a bicycle. After the dog takes the bait, you gradually (over days or weeks) move the treat or toy closer to the feared item. This may go slowly if you have just adopted an abused dog.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "If your cyst is severely infected or you need to shrink the cyst on your back quickly, you can schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor or a dermatologist. For a quick and effective treatment, they may make a small incision to drain the cyst. If the cyst is very inflamed, an injection of cortisone or steroids into the cystic area may provide fast relief.  Both types of injections should cause the cyst to shrink within hours, and both should also relieve any pain or itching caused by the cyst. However, the use of injections may cause the cyst to heal unpredictably, so you might be left with an indentation or scar after the injection takes effect. This result does not happen to everyone, but it is a definite possibility, so keep the risk in mind when considering this option. Depending on size and position of the cyst, your dermatologist may recommend draining it with a needle or a small incision. This is an inpatient procedure that can be done quickly in a doctor's office.  During the procedure, your doctor will usually numb the area before inserting a needle or small, sharp blade directly into the cyst. The pus and other fluids inside the cyst are then drained through the incision, causing the cyst to collapse in the process. The doctor may apply a little pressure to the area to help the pus and other fluids drain out, and to gently squeeze out the core of hardened pus at the center of the cyst. When done carefully, this procedure does not typically cause any major scarring or pain. Surgical removal is usually best when you have a cyst on your back that returns time and time again. Standard excision surgeries are usually relied on for most cyst removals. They can be done with a wide or small excision, depending on your cyst.  Conventional wide excision surgery removes the cyst completely, so it is especially worthwhile if the cyst is suspected to be malignant or if it has caused other health problems. Minimal excision surgery uses a smaller excision to extract the cyst, and as a result, the scarring is much lighter and more likely to heal completely. It is not as effective as wide excision surgery, however, so there is some risk that the cyst will still return. Even with minimal excision surgery, the incision must be a little bigger than the cyst and will need to be closed with 1 or 2 sutures. This procedure is likely to leave a small scar. Depending on your circumstances, your doctor may recommend the use of a laser with a punch biopsy excision. During the procedure, the doctor will use a laser to make a small hole in the cyst. The contents of the cyst are then drained, leaving the outer walls to collapse naturally.  Roughly 1 month later, the drained outer walls are surgically cut and removed. This procedure takes longer to heal overall, but it leaves minimal scarring and usually prevents the cyst from returning. After removing the cyst on your back, your dermatologist should recommend some form of aftercare treatment. This will be designed to minimize scarring and complete the healing process. Most aftercare treatment involves the use of an antibiotic ointment. This ointment should be applied to the affected area as directed, and you should continue using it until the area completely heals.  Aftercare treatment is especially important when a cyst is removed surgically. Some dermatologists may also prescribe a scar cream to lighten and minimize possible scarring.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Ask your doctor for treatments that will give immediate relief.

It will also make you appear as if you'll fit into the work environment.  You can check with the human resources department. They can let you know if there is a dress code and if there isn't ask them what people typically wear to work. One of the best things you can do is meet an employee from the company. Not only can you get a sense of the work environment and not just what people wear. It will give you an edge when you're at the interview. You want to show that you take the job interview seriously. Even if the workplace tends towards jeans and t-shirts, you still want to dress up. You don't have to wear a suit, but should go for something conservative.  For example: if you're interviewing for an office job you should probably dress up in a pantsuit or dress suit. If you're interviewing for something a little more unusual, wear something a little nicer than you normally would. For example: if you're a woman interviewing for a job at a coffee shop, wear a skirt and a nice top (like a sweater); if you're a guy you might wear a pair of nice slacks and a sweater or button down shirt. It's important that you boost your confidence when you're going to an interview because this will make you come across better in the interview. Of course make sure that you strike a balance between something that makes you feel confident and what looks professional.  Check that you don’t have to adjust your clothing (like tugging at your skirt, etc.) and that your clothes don’t ride up inappropriately when you sit down. You should definitely have worn this outfit before, if only to get comfortable in it. Wearing it for the first time when you go to get interviewed will mean that you'll feel and look ill at ease. While your interviewer might not notice if your shoes work with the outfit, they will definitely notice if the shoes look out of place or scruffy. Make sure that your shoes are cleaned and shined and match what you're wearing.  Shoes that are scuffed or scruffy-looking, or dirty are a definite don't. You also want to make sure that your shoes aren't massively uncomfortable, because that will translate into discomfort during the interview. For women, some good ideas for interview shoes are power flats (something clean and professional looking; nothing sparkly or out there), or low, comfortable heels. You don't want heels that make you tower over everyone or that you might wear for a night out clubbing. It makes you look irresponsible. For men, you should go for a pair of loafers or dress shoes as your interview shoes. Make sure, of course, that they aren't scruffy looking and that they are clean and match what you're wearing (no brown with black, for example). When you look like you've just tumbled out of bed, or haven't washed in over a week, you're signalling to the interviewer that you're careless (even if you aren't).  Grooming shows that you care about your professional appearance, which tells the interviewer that you are going to care how you appear as a member of their organization. Make sure that your hair and make-up is appropriate for company. It's best for an interview to keep it subtle. Don't slather on a ton of make-up (the \"natural\" look is best, unless it's for an interview at a department or make-up store). Make sure your hair looks clean and tamed, as much as possible. This is one that a lot of people forget to do. You might be called back for a second interview and you don't want to have to wear the same outfit. Even if the base is the same for both outfits, you want to distinguish them from each other.
