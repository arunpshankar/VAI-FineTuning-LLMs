Sometimes it is easy to be honest. For example, you might be able to truthfully say, \"No, thank you, I already have a date for that party.\" Other times, you might need to find a kinder way to be nice. Maybe you are not attracted to the person. Instead of bluntly saying that, try saying, \"No, thank you, I just don't think we would be a good fit.\" Avoid making up a phony excuse. For instance, don't tell someone you will be out of town this weekend if you won't be. There's a chance that you might then run into them at the movies, which would definitely cause hurt feelings. A compliment sandwich is a really effective way to provide feedback. Essentially, you \"sandwich\" your negative comment between two positive things. Try using this method when you need to reject someone.  An example of a compliment sandwich is to say something such as, \"You're an awesome person. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in dating you. Someone else is going to be really lucky to date someone with such a great personality!\" You could also try, \"You are a really nice person. I'm only interested you as a friend. I like when we hang out in big groups together!\" Be sincere. If you offer false compliments, the other person will likely be able to tell and feel hurt. If you do not want to date someone, it is best to be upfront about your feelings. Do not beat around the bush. If your mind is made up, it is best to clearly state your response.  If someone asks you to date them and you don't want to, you can be direct and kind at the same time. State your answer clearly. You can make your feelings clear without purposefully hurting someone else's feelings. Try smiling and saying, \"That sounds fun, but no thank you.

You don't want to give someone false hope. Avoid saying something like, \"Let me check my schedule and get back to you.\" Try to treat the person the way you would want to be treated. This means that you should choose your words carefully. Be thoughtful in your response.  It's okay to pause before responding. You might be taken by surprise and need a moment to collect your thoughts. Say thank you. It is a compliment to be asked out. You can say, \"I'm flattered. Unfortunately, I can't accept.\" Don't laugh. Many people laugh nervously in awkward situations. Try to avoid giggling, as that is likely to result in hurt feelings. Sometimes it is not what you say, but how you say it. If you need to reject someone, think about factors other than your words. Non-verbal communication matters, too.  Use the right tone of voice. Try to sound gentle but firm. Make eye contact. This helps convey that you are being serious, and also shows respect for the other person. If you are in public, try not to speak too loudly.

These quizzes will determine your personal style by having you choose between different rooms, accessories, and pieces of furniture. As you take the quiz, reflect on whether or not you could see yourself relaxing and/or entertaining guests in each space. Some styles that these quizzes may determine you have include:  Happy modern Warm industrial Eclectic collector Classic glam Keep in mind that a single style may not fit your tastes. Feel free to mix and match elements to create a unique, but cohesive, style. Buy some interior decorating magazines and cut out any rooms, furniture pieces, and accessories in the magazines that you like and then make a collage or scrapbook out of the clippings. Search your specific decor style on sites like Pinterest and save any pins that you like to your “Decor Style” board. This should help you develop a clearer sense of style. Include your specific style in your Pinterest search. For example, search “modern style large living room” or “traditional style large living room.” You likely already own several furniture pieces and accessories that fit your style, so go through your home and make note of what you enjoy having and what you’d like to replace. Get rid of the pieces that don’t fit your vision and purchase new pieces that stay true to your style.  If you can’t afford to get several new pieces at once, keep your current furniture and accessories and replace one at a time over the course of several months. To save money, consider changing the pieces you can without replacing them. For instance, you could paint an old boring dresser that you have a bright color or change the upholstery on your dining room chairs to better fit your style. You can also repurpose items to fit your needs. For instance, instead of buying a new coffee table, make one out of crates or a large trunk. As you’re trying to determine your style, consider who you are and what kind of life you live. For instance, if you’re always planning your next trip and are passionate about seeing the world, you may want to go for a boho world-traveler theme that incorporates bright worldly colors, antique furniture, and organic textures, such as wooden stools and leather poufs. Some other styles you may consider include:  Top-notch tastemaker: classic designer pieces, neutral backdrop, and high-tech gadgets.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "When you’re ready to start writing, dip the nib in the bottom of ink to fill the vent. Then, with the pen still held just inside the bottle, give the pen a quick downward shake. This should help remove any excess ink built up on the pen tip. You don’t need a protractor to get exactly the precise angle, but you should practice holding the pen the right way. Use a normal pen grip, then hold the pen so it’s perpendicular to the paper, or straight out with the nib pointed at the sheet. Then, bring the pen down until it’s angled almost halfway between parallel and perpendicular.   This will give you more control over the pen, making it easier to create the strokes. Touch the tip of the nib to the top of your x-height, or the middle row on your lined paper. Then, using even pressure, draw the tip of the nib straight down to create a vertical line. Repeat this several times, trying to leave an equal amount of space between each line. Once you feel comfortable with your vertical strokes, it’s time to add a flourish. Draw a vertical line just as you did before, then stop about 1 nib-width above the baseline and pull the pen to the right.  The serif should be a horizontal line about 1 nib-width across. If you lift the pen before drawing the serif, make sure it’s completely connected to the previous stroke, without any spaces. Practice this several times, as well. Many letters also have a serif at the top. To create this, start at the waist line, or the second line on your ruled sheet, and draw a horizontal stroke that’s about 1 nib-width to the right. Then, without picking the pen up from the paper, draw a line straight down to the baseline. You can also practice starting your serif at the top line, rather than the waist line. Now that you’ve practiced creating serifs on the top and the bottom of the letters, it’s time to put it all together. Draw a serif at the top of your waist line, then draw a straight line down, stopping about 1 nib-width from the baseline. Finish by drawing another serif at the bottom of the line.  Keep practicing until the top and bottom serifs are the same size each time you draw this shape. This is a basic lower-case “i,” or a lowercase “l” if you start from the top line. It can sometimes help to trace a letter to get a feel for its construction. Once you've mastered drawing a line with a serif, lay a sheet of printer paper over the sample alphabet you printed. Then, trace over the letter with your calligraphy pen, trying to match the serifs and flourishes as closely as possible. It can be helpful to practice one letter several times before moving on to the next one. Once you feel comfortable tracing the letters, start writing them freehand. Try practicing letters that are entirely contained in the x-height to start. Letters made up of all straight lines, like i, m, n, and w, are the easiest to learn first.  You’ve already practiced drawing “i” and “l,” so try drawing “m” next. This is an easy letter because it’s made of 3 straight lines, then 2 serifs as connectors. The letters “a,” “c,” “e,” “i,” “m,” “n,” “o,” “r,” “s,” “u,” “v,” “w,” “x,” and “z” will all be contained within the x-height. The row above the x-height is for your ascenders, or the long lines reaching up above letters like “b” and “h.” The top serif on the letter “t” also goes into your ascender row, although it’s not quite as tall as the other ascenders. Other letters with an ascender are “d,” “f,” “k,” and “l.” For letters that drop down, like “g,” or “j,” draw your lines below the baseline, reaching all the way down to the bottom row. In some cases, you might add decorative flourishes that reach down in the descender’s row, also. Other letters with descenders are “p,” “q,” and “y.” ” When you’re dotting an “i” or “j,” a dot will look too small, while a full nib-mark will be too wide. Instead, use the tip of your pen to create a very thin, angled stroke on top of those letters. Typically, the mark will be angled upward from left to right. However, you can play around with this if you'd like to take more of a creative approach to your calligraphy.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Dip the pen nib in the ink, then shake it firmly.

Take 6 cups of hickory or mesquite chips, and soak them for an hour in enough cold water to cover the wood. When the hour is up, drain the water from the chips so they’re ready for the grill. If you’re using wood chunks in your grill, it isn’t necessary to soak them beforehand. In fact, soaking wood chunks can actually make it take longer to get them burning.

Once the charcoal pieces are hot and red, add them to the bottom of the grill. However, make sure to create two piles, one on each side of the grill with the center area free of coal. Some grills have special baskets that are designed for holding the charcoal in piles on either side of the grill. If your model has them, you can place the coals in the baskets.

Surface color skin tones are fair, light, medium, or dark.  Fair skin tones are light and burn easily. Light skin tones are also fair but have more beige and yellow undertones than fair skin. Medium skin tones are darker and have olive undertones and usually have green, warm brown, or hazel eyes. Dark skin tones are deep and rich. Those with dark skin tones typically have dark brown eyes.  Your surface skin tone may change depending on the season or how much time you spend in the sun. Unlike surface skin tone, undertones remain constant regardless of skin conditions like rosacea and acne. To determine your undertone, look at the color of your veins in your wrist. If your veins appear blue or purple, you have a cool undertone. If they appear greener, then you are warm-toned. Neural toned people will have blue-green veins.  Many people from African or Indian who have an easy time tanning have warm undertones. If you get red, flush easily, or burn when tanning, you most likely have a cool skin undertone. The color of your eyes also contributes to your overall tone. Those with golden brown, green, and blue eyes are normally warm-toned. Additionally, those with gold specs in their eyes commonly have warm undertones. Those with black or deep, steel blue, or hazel with gray or blue flecks have cool undertones.

Doing this will allow your dye to look natural and attractive.  Those with a cool tone look good in colors like wheat blond, walnut brown, tawny blond, golden caramel, or copper.

Don’t try to start a conversation at an obviously bad time, like in the middle of a quiz or while the person is distracted by other things that seem to be commanding their attention. Realize that some people don’t like talking in certain situations. Some people don’t enjoy talking while riding the bus or wiping the cafeteria tables. If they don’t seem to warm up to your attempts to engage them in conversation, let it go. The adage that people like to talk about themselves turns out to be largely true. And questions are also great icebreakers.  If you don’t know how to start a conversation with someone, begin with a question like, “What’s the homework?” or “Who are you taking for biology?”  A good way to get closer to someone is to ask them questions about themselves. Ask questions about their hobbies, their family. their pets, etc. If they tell you about something they did or accomplished, ask them how they got into it and why. Key to getting to know someone is listening carefully to what they say.  Show that you’re giving them your full attention by holding eye contact, nodding your head, and pitching in small comments here and there to show you’re following the thread of the conversation. As you ask the other person questions, listen carefully to their answers to find out what the person is most interested in or passionate about. If one topic doesn’t elicit much of a response from them, don’t keep asking more questions about it. Instead, move on to another topic. Once you find a topic the other person seems excited about or has more to say about, ask follow-up questions and pitch in your own thoughts to keep the conversation going. People feel more at ease when you mirror their body language--subtly. Don’t pantomime their every movement, just subtly adopt similar body postures.  If they’re leaning forward, do the same. If they’re sitting with their legs crossed, cross yours. If they’re showing negative or closed-off body language (arms crossed, legs crossed while standing, or hands in their pockets), don’t mirror the negative body language. Instead, take that as a cue that they’re not feeling at ease. Adopt an open body language (leaning forward if sitting, arms at your sides with palms out, shoulders back, and legs shoulder-width apart, with feet towards the other person if standing) and try to redirect the conversation to something that elicits a more positive response. When you’re nervous or tense, you make other people nervous or tense--which most people don’t like.  Don’t psych yourself out. Practice quieting the doubting voice in your head telling you “you look so awkward right now” or “they’re just going to laugh at you.” Realize that it’s only the voice of insecurity and it doesn’t have any actual merit. Breathe. When you’re nervous you tend to hold your breath or take quick, shallow breaths, which perpetuates your nervousness. To calm yourself, take several full, deep breaths before approaching the person you want to talk to and remind yourself to keep taking deep, regular breaths throughout the conversation. Sharing too much about yourself too quickly can be off-putting.  Don’t tell the other person your entire life story. Not only do they probably not care enough to listen to you talk all about yourself at this point, people tend to see people who overshare about themselves as having poor boundaries or being self-obsessed. When first getting to know someone, keep the personal details fairly general. Don’t get into details that might make the conversation awkward, like your cousin’s stint in jail or your sister’s habit of eating paper towels.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Choose your moment.

Only disturb the soil when you have to, so that you don’t inadvertently raise weed seeds.  Weed seeds can lay dormant under the soil for years.  Hoeing or tilling in weed prone areas may inadvertently bring up dormant weed seeds in the process.  Many plants need an exposure to sunlight to germinate. Cultivating at night reduces the chance that weeds will germinate. If you are having an issue with weeds growing in between cracks in a walkway or sidewalk, try using salt to prevent future weed growth. Be warned that salt will also kill other vegetation in the area, so make sure to use it only in spots that are weed prone.  Amine salt is a good solution for killing weeds and can be combined with water in a spray bottle for easier application.  Borax is another, more caustic solution to killing weeds in small cracks. Make sure to use gloves when handling it. Weeds like to grow in open areas that are abundant in nutrients and minerals.

If you suffer from high blood pressure, take steps to reduce your sodium intake:  Do not add salt to foods when cooking but use other spices instead (cumin, lemon pepper, fresh herbs). Rinse canned foods to remove sodium. Buy foods that are labeled “low sodium” or “sodium free.” Avoid processed foods, such as crackers, fried items, and baked goods, that often are high in sodium. Also avoid eating fast food and ask for reduced sodium when ordering in restaurants. A high fiber diet may help reduce your risk of hypertension. Fortunately, it’s easy to get fiber from the healthy foods you’re likely already eating. Incorporate more whole grains, fresh veggies, and fruit with the skin on it into your diet. This will help you consume at least 25 grams of fiber each day.  Make sure you get at least six to eight servings of whole grains every day. Switch refined grains to whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat pasta and bread. Potassium-rich foods should be a part of your hypertension management diet. Foods you should add include sweet potatoes, tomatoes, kidney beans, orange juice, bananas, peas, potatoes, dried fruits, melon and cantaloupe. Keep your target potassium levels moderate (around 2,000 to 4,000 mg a day). Dark chocolate may help lower blood pressure, though it might not work the same for everyone. Eat dark chocolate whenever you’re craving a treat. Choose a bar that has at least 70% cocoa.  Eat a half an ounce of dark chocolate that has at least 70% of cocoa per day.  Because dark chocolate is high in calories, be sure not to overindulge. Besides being bad for blood pressure, caffeine and alcohol also have other negative health effects to you and your baby during pregnancy. Thus, you should avoid both, especially if you suffer from high blood pressure.  Drinking caffeine during pregnancy has been linked to declined placental blood flow and a risk of miscarriage. Although more studies are needed to confirm the effects of caffeine, it is best to switch to decaf during your pregnancy.  High alcohol consumption is known to raise blood pressure and it is also known to have negative effects on your unborn baby. Before drinking any alcohol, even just one glass of wine, consult your doctor. A clinical study demonstrated that systolic blood pressure can be lowered by adding these foods to your diet.  Add low-fat or fat-free dairy products (such as milk, cottage cheese, yogurt) to your diet. If you are lactose intolerant, try a milk alternative, such as almond, coconut, or hemp milk.  You can also try soy milk, but you may want to limit soy products during pregnancy since it may increase estrogen levels in your fetus.

Play muted notes, where you aren't pressing fully on the fret, to get a percussive \"note\" instead of a melody. Varying these \"textures\" is a great way to build an essential sense of rhythm into your bass lines. Funk gains power through repetition. You are the one keeping the band and melody on track, providing a sturdy base to dance on. You don't want to be switching up your licks or grooves every 2-3 bars, you want to be reliable. However, the occasional deviation is exciting, fresh, and funky. Every 4 bars or so, mix it up -- hitting a higher version of your root note, sliding out of the lick, etc. By restraining yourself, you make your subtle deviations even more exciting. Stevie Wonder's \"Higher Ground\" has a kicking, relatively regular bassline. But, when Stevie's' voice kicks it up an octave, he switches up the final two beats with a nasty little slide that signals the shift in and out of the chord change. The notes you play are just as important as the ones you don't. Syncopation, which is when you leave pauses and spaces where listeners expect a note, is crucial to good funk. In general, spaces are used to make the note immediately before or after feel more important, meaning the two and four beats are great places to put a little silence.  Rhythmic variety is created by having spaces. And variety, especially when synced up with your drummer, is where the funk starts to shine. Check out Kendrick Lamar's \"King Kunta\", paying attention to the just barely syncopated pause after the three beat. You expect the note to hold, like it does after the one, but the unexpected syncopation gives it a fresh, immediately danceable feel. Once you have the rhythm down, getting the groove with a few simple notes, you can expand your funky chops but copying the masters. Look up the tabs to every song that catches your ear. Focus on getting them perfect, note for note. How do other masters fill in the gaps? How do they emphasize the one and three? How do they use silence to their advantage? While you should listen to anything you love, some classic bassists to start with include:  Larry Graham (with Sly and the Family Stone, Graham Central Station) Bootsy Collins (with Parliament-Funkadelic, James Brown, his own band) James Jamerson (with the James Brown Band) Victor Wooten (solo, with SMV)\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Get physical with your strings.

Always check with your doctor first before discontinuing or adding any medication or supplement. The recommended dosage for fenugreek is between 2.5–15 grams (0.09–0.5 oz) daily, so it is important to talk to your doctor about your intentions and ask for a recommendation based on your weight and other factors. You may also want to consult an experienced herbalist or naturopath. The most common dose used in studies was 12.5 grams (0.4 oz) of powdered fenugreek taken twice daily. However, some studies have shown benefit from taking only 2.5 grams (0.09 oz) twice daily. Some people do not like the taste of fenugreek seeds, so capsules are often recommended.  If you choose to take fenugreek in supplement form, make sure that the product you choose is of high quality. The packaging should provide:   Realistic information about the effects of taking the supplement Information such as dosage recommendations, side effects, and ingredients A label that is easy to read and understand Company information such as a phone number, mailing address, or website. Some people do like the taste of fenugreek and may opt to add the seeds to food. You can seek out recipes that include fenugreek or simply sprinkle the seeds on your food as a garnish. Keep in mind that you should still follow your doctor’s recommendations for healthy eating. When adding fenugreek to food, 15 grams (0.53 oz) was a common dosage in some studies.

Thus, no single guide is likely to provide a one-size-fits-all solution. The steps in this section are meant to be taken as general guidelines for a simple on-off ((single pole, single throw or SPST) toggle switch. They should never supersede any instructions included with your toggle switch or the device into which you're installing it. When in doubt, consult a skilled electrician to save time and avoid inadvertent damage. For your toggle switch to function as an on-off switch, you'll need to wire your toggle switch to the device's power supply. Use wire cutters to cut your device's supply wire in a location that best allows for routing either or both ends of the wire to the switch. Strip approximately 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation from each end of the wire using a wire stripper. A pigtail is a short length of wire (usually about 6 inches (15 cm)) with both ends stripped. It can be connected to wires that aren't quite long enough to reach your toggle switch as a sort of \"extender.\" Add a pigtail as follows:  Determine the gauge of the existing wire and obtain a wire of the same color and gauge. Cut a piece of the wire long enough to reach from the cut end of the supply wire to the toggle switch. Strip 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of insulation from each end of this piece of wire. Connect one end of the pigtail wire to the supply wire by twisting the ends of the wires together clockwise. Twist a wire nut of the proper size clockwise over the wire joint until the wire nut is tight. At this point, you've made a break in the device's supply wire, you'll need to add your toggle switch in the middle of the break so that it can regulate the flow of electricity through the circuit. The way you do this depends on the type of toggle switch you have. See below:  If your toggle switch has wire leads, twist the end of each lead to one of the supply wires (or pigtail extensions) and twist a wire nut over each wire connection until they're tight. If your toggle switch has screw terminals, loosen the terminal screws, loop the ends of the supply wires and hook each loop over a terminal screw so the loops point clockwise around the shaft of each terminal screw. Then, tighten the terminal screws. If the toggle switch has solder connections, bend the ends of the wires around the switch terminals. Needle-nose pliers may be useful. Heat each terminal with a soldering iron while holding the end of solder wire in contact with the terminal (but not in direct contact with the soldering iron tip). When the solder begins to melt, withdraw the soldering iron tip and allow the melting solder to flow and cover the wire-terminal joint. When your toggle switch is wired properly, carefully reconnect the device's power supply and test the function of the toggle switch. If it works as intended, you may replace the panel or device housing. Congratulations!

It's usually more fun to get a friend to make one of his own however. That way, your duel will be a test of your craftsmanship as well as your duelling skills. Now that you have a sword, you could go the extra mile and make matching armour to boot. Armour may constitute a breastplate, grieves, gauntlets and even a shield. Part of the fun is thinking up ways to transform the cardboard you have into functional pieces of armour, but plenty of fancy designs are available online as well.  Don't forget to decorate your armour! Anything from felt-tipped markers to glued-on construction paper can liven up your cardboard and bring the armour to life. If you're tired of working with cardboard, you can make great looking armour sets using crafts foam. Duelling is possibly the most enjoyable part of having a sword. It allows you to put your sword design to the test. If your friend has a cardboard sword of his own, you should lay down some quick ground rules and jump into it. Duels are most enjoyable when there are rules of how to win. Going in blindly usually results in the swords being swung as hard as possible and getting broken within the first couple of minutes.  Bear in mind that the swords are relatively fragile when compared to real swords, and they should be used with that in mind. Start a cardboard fighting group if the idea interests you enough. There are already groups in existence where people meet up and play fight with cardboard weapons. Instead of starting one of your own with friends, you can look online to see if there's already a group in your city. Working some kind of live-action roleplaying (or LARPing) into the game can be fun if you're interested in fantasy or Medieval history. Cardboard swords are perfect for use in costumes and events like Halloween. Even if you have a costume in mind that doesn't necessarily befit a sword, feel free to mix and match ideas. You might be surprised at the response you get when you combine unexpected ideas together. Now that you're relatively experienced in the art of sword craft, you might go back to the drawing board and make a better kind of sword. Consider what was good and bad about the sword you made. If you were to make one again, what would you improve?

Soap, although important in hygiene, can cause irritation and may not help in removing any of the dead skin caused by dryness. Instead, rinse your feet thoroughly with warm water every time you bathe in order to promote moisture. Warm water (40 to 34°C) promotes circulation and both comforts and refreshes your feet. Always wash the bottoms of your feet well and between your toes. You should use a washcloth to get between your toes or use a long handled sponge on your feet if you prefer not to have to bend down in the shower. Make sure you dry well between your toes with a towel as this will prevent the develop of infection, and reduce any odors or bacteria on your feet. Tight, uncomfortable shoes can cause painful foot growths and distort your toe shape. They can also irritate your feet and lead to blisters and cracked skin. Try to wear comfortable shoes that fit well on a daily basis, especially if you are always on your feet throughout the day.  If you wear high heels, look for heels that are wide, stable, and no higher than two inches. Make sure there is enough room in your heels for your toes, as your shoes should not narrow until well past the balls of your feet. You should also alternate your heels heights regularly to prevent your Achilles tendon from shortening. Avoid wearing flip flops and completely flat shoes, as they do not provide arch support. You should also avoid walking around barefoot to avoid developing flat feet. Minimize the amount of time you wear shoes with no arch support to keep your feet healthy and strong. Try to alternate your shoes so you do not wear the same pair every day, even if you have two pairs of the same style. This will prevent shoe odor, and foot infections. You should also change your socks every day so you wear a fresh pair. This will prevent foot irritation and infections, which could trigger dry and cracked skin.

This device takes AA batteries for its battery pack, which is connected to a long wire that reaches the squeezable trigger mechanism. The mechanism is made to be attached to your chest, but can be placed anywhere. A hose then runs from the mechanism to the dispenser tip, which you can place near your mouth so it would appear as if you are smoking. Pure Smoke creates similar vapor to that of fog machines used on stage, but in lesser quantities. When purchasing this product, you will receive 11 cartridges, which is about 850 puffs of smokes. It may be a little pricy to some, but it's effective! Make sure when buying Pure Smoke that you are buying the kind specifically to create fog or fake smoke on stage. There are other types of pure smoke used for Hookah and electronic cigarettes, so you'll want to avoid those. These can be very useful if you are trying to trick someone and make them believe you are smoking a real cigarette. They can be purchased online, or you can create your own.

Place cotton at one end and then pour a white powder into the other end. Now, blow from either end and it will look like you are smoking a cigarette! Be aware that these cigarettes don't last very long. They allow you to make a few puffs of smoke, but because you are just making smoke with the powder inside the cigarette, you won't be able to use it for hours on end. A really unique way to create smoke is by using the powder that ground up Smarties create. You can do this by grinding up the candy and rolling it into a piece of paper like a toy cigarette, or you can use the wrapper.  When using the wrapper, smash the Smarties inside the wrapper, keeping both sides wrapped and then open up one end and gently inhale the Smartie dust and breathe out. Unlike the toy cigarettes, you will inhale the smoke from the Smarties, but make sure you don't take too deep of a breath.

If nothing happens to the plastic, the solvent may be safe to use. Keep in mind that some solvents may need hours before they have an adverse effect on your item. If the plastic changes color or texture, don’t use the solvent. You might even want to press the area with your fingernail; if you see an indent, choose a different solvent.

Simply soak your cotton ball with your solution, then rub it across the painted area until the paint comes off.  Discard the cotton ball when it gets dirty, and use a new one.

Here are some ways to be supportive:  If you know they have a big test coming up, then you should either give them space to study or help them if you can. If they're really passionate about soccer, tennis, or some other school sport, then you should cheer them on the sidelines during their big games. If they're going through some trouble at home, make sure to be extra attentive and to ask if there's anything you can do. And if they don't want to talk about it, they don't want to talk about it. Ask about their interests. If you know they're passionate about painting or playing the violin, support them by letting them talk about these interests and sharing how much they mean to them. It's very important to be attentive to your partner, and it's also key to pay attention to their friends. Friends can make or break teenage relationships, and if their friends love you, they'll tell them how lucky they are to have found an amazing guy like you. But if they don't like you because you're rude or ignore them, they'll tell them that you're a jerk and may even convince them that they can do better and that they should break up with you ASAP.  Be friendly to their friends. Say hi, even if your partner isn't around, and ask them how they're doing. You can even talk to them about their interests and get to know them a bit.  Don't ignore them. If you approach your partner when they're with a group of friends, make sure to greet them when you do. Don't tell your partner that you don't like their friends. Even if they're a little annoying, they mean a lot to them, and if you admit this, you'll be making a rift in your relationship. This is an important point. If your partner is hanging out with you and your buddies, or even if you're hanging out in a group surrounded by all of your friends, you should still pay attention to them and let them know that they're important to you. Don't ditch them as soon as your friends show up, or they'll start to feel like a burden or like a last priority.  If you two are hanging out with your friends, you should sit next to them and include them in the conversation. Don't leave them hanging. Help your friends get to know them. If your friends are shy or awkward around your partner, it'll be hard to have a good time. Bring up some common interests for your friends and your partner to talk about. If you really want to be attentive, then you should notice when your partner wants to be left alone. Space and privacy are necessary for every healthy relationship, so don't be put off if it seems like your partner wants a night to themselves or even a night with their friends. If you're always around, then your relationship may be becoming too intense. Take some time apart from your partner so you have time to gain perspective and realize how much you miss each other.  If you're always around, then they may start to feel that you're controlling or domineering. Let them do their own thing. If they want to be alone, be cool with it. If you look upset or hurt, they'll think you're insecure. Leave some room in their schedule. Don't try to plan your weekends so you're together every second and don't have time for your families or other friends.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Understand their moods.

This may be a better option if you are planning to do more than three tiers. Take your top tier piece and fold over about ½” to 1” (depending on the width of your elastic) of fabric of one of the long edges so that the wrong sides (non-print or non-color sides) are facing each other. This will be the waistband of your skirt. Sew along this edge to create the waistband.  Make sure to leave enough space to add your elastic in later. Leave a small 1” to 2” gap in the seam to insert the elastic. It is easier to hem the bottom of your skirt before you start to gather your pieces and sew them together.

To gather the bottom tier, sew a baste stitch into the top of the bottom tier (not the edge that you just hemmed). If you want, you can sew a permanent stitch over the baste stitch when it is gathered to your liking. However, sewing the middle tier to the bottom tier will create this permanent stitch, so it is not absolutely necessary to stitch over the baste stitch. Line up the edges so that the right sides of your fabric are facing each other. Then, pin along these edges about ¼” to ½” inch from the edge of the fabric.  Be sure to line up the center seams on the bottom and middle tiers. If you did not create the center seam yet, then make sure that the ends are even. You can adjust the gathering before you start pinning the pieces together to make sure that the pieces are the same length. After you have pinned all the way around the pieces, sew the pieces together, removing the pins as you sew. Next, you will need to repeat the baste stitch on the top of your middle tier, but this time you will be gathering the fabric so that it is the same size as your top tier piece. Add your baste stitch and then adjust until the middle tier piece matches your top tier piece. After you have gathered the middle piece to match the top tier piece, begin pinning the wrong sides together. Pin all the way around the pieces and then sew the two pieces together.

Some timer models may have the power wires in a different access panel along the wall. Your sprinkler wires can be found plugged into a numbered section inside your timer. Wrap a small piece of masking tape around each of the sprinkler wires and label them with the number of the port they’re plugged into. That way, you’ll know what stations to plug your wires back into when you put in your new unit. If you don’t have any tape or labels, many sprinkler wires are differently colored so you can tell which wires control an area.

For example, you can caress a girl on her arm, face, calf, or upper back to start.  If you have never caressed her before, try holding her hand to start. If she lets you hold her hand, and holds onto it for a while, then she might be interested in more touching and you can try touching her back or arm next. If she likes what you are doing, you can start trying different places on her body. For example, you might move from her upper back to her lower back, or from her calf to her thigh. Watch for cues that she is open to this, such as smiling or moving towards your touch. Avoid touching areas of her body that she might be sensitive about, such as her stomach. Girls love it when guys play with their hair and caress it. It's a romantic gesture that seems to have emotion behind it.   Tuck her hair behind her ear. If you notice her hair has come undone, or is in her way, brush it off her face. It probably won't stay there, but she'll definitely notice the gesture. Girls enjoy having their long hair played with, stroked, and brushed. Run your fingers through her mane, eventually working your way up her neck to rub behind her ears. A girl's face and neck are intimate places to caress, but touching a girl in these places is a good place to start caressing. Try stroking her cheek and neck with one hand as talk to her and gaze into her eyes. Gently brushing your fingers across her cheek is a really good way to let her know you want to kiss her, and give her time to react. You can also try caressing a girl's hands as a good starting place. This is a form of caressing that you can do in public as well.   Try rubbing your thumb across the back of her hand while you hold hands. If you notice her hand sitting on a table next to you, try holding hands across the table, and then giving her palm a little massage. If you think that your relationship has progressed enough to try caressing her in more intimate areas, then you can try caressing those areas. Just watch her cues and listen to her. If she says she does not want to be caressed in a certain place, then back off and go back to something less intimate like holding hands.  Touching the outer thighs is a flirtatious move that you might try if you are in an intimate relationship. Try running your hands down the sides of her waist and down towards her thighs, and then bring them back up to rest near her hips. Other areas of the body that are sensitive but often overlooked include the small of her back and her feet. However, be careful when caressing these areas because she might be ticklish.

Some things you may not be able to prevent or control. Before taking any official actions, consider how you might solve the problem on your own by talking to your neighbors. However, if your neighbor's behavior puts you at immediate risk, such as a sanitation issue, don't hesitate to speak up. You may have behaviors or habits that cause issues for your neighbors.  If you tend to be noisy or messy, consider quieting down or cleaning up. If you have annoying habits, your neighbors will be less accommodating if you complain about them. Therefore, make sure you are on your best behavior and see if your neighbors follow suit. You should see if they are having problems or issues with the people you find annoying or that are causing issues for you.

Do you feel like the other person is willing or able to meet certain needs, or allow you to pursue your own interests? A narcissist will only be able to see their needs and wants, and often expect them to be met even if it's unreasonable or interferes with your own needs and wants. They are good at manipulating others, so if you confront them with your feelings, they're likely to get hostile instead of apologizing and changing. For example, you're extroverted by nature and like to go out on the weekends. Your boyfriend gets nervous at big parties, and expects you to stay by his side the whole time, even when he refuses to socialize with others. When you express the fact your need for socialization isn't met, he insists you instead meet his need for attention and reassurance. Rather than working towards a compromise, a narcissistic boyfriend will instead continue to put his needs first, regardless of whether it's reasonable. Being a narcissistic extension is draining. If you're in a relationship with a narcissist, they will take up a lot of your time and energy. Consider whether you have time for yourself. Are you allowed to pursue your own hobbies and interests? Do you have separate relationships with family members and friends? If not, you may be a narcissistic extension. A narcissist will not see you as a separate entity, with your own ideas and opinions.

Therapy may be key to overcoming social anxiety. A therapist can help you with Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), which teaches you a different way of thinking, behaving, and reacting to social situations. It can help you feel less anxious and fearful. CBT helps you learn how to manage physical symptoms through relaxation and breathing, replace negative thoughts with more balanced ones, and gradually face social situations. In group therapy situations, you undergo CBT in a group setting. This includes role-playing, social skills training, acting, video taping, and mock interviews. These exercises are supposed to help you face situations that would make you anxious in the real world and prepare for them. A support group is different than group therapy because it's aimed at helping you gain support you need during your recovery. Support groups can help you not feel isolated with your anxiety. You can look for support groups in your areas. Try a CBT based self-help app like Joyable. https://joyable.com/. This app pairs cognitive techniques, education, and a personal coach to help you through social anxiety. Sometimes medication can be used to help with the symptoms of social anxiety, but medicine will not cure it. As soon as you stop the medication, symptoms such as anxiety will return.

Remove the wrapping paper, as paper can bruise the flowers and cellophane can cause them to sweat. When cut flowers have been left out of water for any length of time, cells start to form over the cut ends of the stems, which will prevent the stems taking up water readily. To remove this sealed portion, snip off about 2.5cm (1\") from the stem ends and then place in water preferably with preservative added, and allow the flowers to have a long drink before arranging. Warm water should be used as flowers take up warm water more readily than cold.  Flowers only drink through the ends of the stems and not through the sides of the stems, and for this reason buckets should not be filled right up to the top with water, as foliage left on stems below the water line will rot and pollute the water. This will feed bacteria and the flowers will die more quickly. The foliage of Marigolds, Chrysanthemums, Stock and Daisies send off a particularly strong odor when left standing under water over a period of time. Use a sharp pair of secateurs and cut the flower stems on an angle - a slanted cut allows a better intake of water. Remove all foliage from the lower portion of the stems which would stand under the water line. Place the flowers immediately in the water. Allow enough air to circulate between each flower. Too many flowers crowded together in a bucket may cause the petals to become squashed and bruised. Place the bucket in a cool dark place and allow the flowers to have a long drink before being arranged. When picking short-stemmed flowers, use a smaller container. This step is called conditioning. It allows the stems to fill up with water and the flowers will become crisp. These flowers will last twice as long as those that have not been conditioned properly. Flower preservatives  are available in garden centers or supermarkets. Another alternative is to use a cap-full of household bleach in the water. If a preservative is not used, the water needs to be changed and the stems cut on an angle daily. If a preservative is used, the stems do not require re-cutting and water needs changing only about twice a week. Flowers, like Freesias, Spray Carnations and Liliums, have lots of buds.

Unless there's truly no other option, try to defuse or avoid physical violence at all costs. Do your best to make peace or simply walk away, if you can.

Your primary goal should be getting yourself out of harm's way.  Getting away from a violent situation before it erupts should be considered a victory. If a fight becomes unavoidable, stay relaxed. When you panic, your ability to gauge your surroundings and employ effective strategies shuts down. Keep your hands up to defend your head at all times. Your forearms should be held vertical and parallel, with palms turned inward toward your cheeks. Squeeze your fists together lightly until you’re ready to throw a counterpunch. Hunch slightly to bring your elbows down closer to your midsection to protect your ribs and abdomen from body blows.  Don’t allow your guard to fall or get lax, even when you’re tired. Dropping your guard leaves you wide open for that one good shot which could mean the end of the fight. Make sure you assume a guard from which you can quickly and comfortably deliver punches or elbow strikes. An aggressor who is bigger than you is also likely to be stronger, so it’s not recommended that you try to stop his attacks directly. Instead, stay mobile to swiftly escape from his punching range. Making him chase you will exhaust him, and with every missed attack he’ll lose a little more steam. If there’s no chance of getting a safe distance away, slide your head to the outside of the punch so that it passes by harmlessly, then immediately rush in and hit back.  Evading is always preferable to blocking because it doesn’t require you to absorb force with any part of the body. Dodging a punch using only head movement is known in boxing as a “slip.” Slipping punches is an excellent way to avoid being hit while expending minimal energy. The bigger, stronger person always has the edge in a grappling match. Don’t put yourself in unnecessary danger by allowing your opponent to take hold of you. Keep just outside his reach until the time comes to counter, then capitalize and pull away again. If the fight goes to the ground, you’re looking at a scenario where you have even less control, as your speed, evasiveness and precision will go right out the window.

Keep this in mind and ready yourself mentally. Getting hit is no fun, but it could end up being much worse if you let it take you by surprise.  If you do have to take a hit, try to do it on the shoulder or forehead, which is a harder, less vulnerable surface than the jaw or the rest of the face.

For instance, you should get cavities filled before whitening your teeth to prevent compounded problems and pain from the bleach. Your dentist will be able to examine your teeth and suggest the best whitening method for your particular case. They can also recommend products or strategies to help you protect your gums while whitening your teeth. The type of discoloration you have will dictate the best treatment.  For instance, your teeth may have extrinsic stains in which the enamel, or outer layer of your teeth, is discolored from eating or drinking dark foods and beverages, like coffee and wine, or from smoking or chewing tobacco. Alternatively, your teeth may have intrinsic stains, in which the interior dentin is discolored from excessive fluoride or certain medications like chlorhexidine, minocycline, or even antihistamines. Your dentist may recommend a treatment done in the dental office, in which case they will take care to protect your gums during the whitening treatment. Usually, the dentist will use a stronger solution to whiten your teeth than is available over-the-counter, and they may use lights or a laser to speed up the process.

Plant roots hold the soil together, while their leaves block rain and stop it breaking the soil apart. Turf, ornamental grass, and low, spreading shrubs work best since they cover the soil completely.  If you have any bare ground, try to establish plant cover as soon as possible to limit erosion. If the ground is mostly flat (slope of 3:1 or less), this might be enough to solve the problem. Steep slopes erode faster, so they need more protection. This will weigh down the soil and protect the seeds and young plants underneath from getting washed away. It also slows the absorption of water to reduce runoff. Grass clippings or bark chips work especially well. If you don’t plant anything, keep the soil covered with mulch. You can also add mulch around plants to add another layer of protection or to keep the soil warm. Simply lay the mat over your seeds or young plants. On steep slopes, dig a small trench at the top of the hill first. Lay the top of the mat in the trench, fill it up with soil, then fold the mat back over the top. This helps water run over the top of the mat, where the mat will slow it down, instead of traveling underneath it. Fiber mulch mats or erosion control mats are a layer of mulch held together in a fiber mesh. This structure holds the mulch together in areas where normal mulch would be washed or blown away. Another option for erosion control on steep slopes is a series of rolled up logs or \"wattles\" made from fibrous material (like straw). Water running down the slope will slow down when it hits the logs, soaking into the soil instead of carrying mud downhill. Put the logs down across the slope, 10 to 25 feet (3–8m) apart. Hold them in place with wooden stakes or sturdy, living plants.  You can plant seeds directly in the logs to protect them while they grow. If you do plant seeds directly into the logs, you should still use stakes to hold the logs in place, at least until the seeds develop sturdy roots that go into the soil. . Badly eroded slopes will continue to collapse downhill until they are stabilized. A retaining wall at the base of the slope will block the soil and slow down the collapse. This gives grass or other plants time to grow and help the soil hold together.  Give the wall a 2% slope on the side (perpendicular to the incline) so that water flows off to the side instead of pooling.  You may build the wall from concrete blocks, rock, or wood. Only use wood treated with a preservative to prevent rot.  Use retaining walls around flowerbeds and other raised soil areas as well. You may need local government approval to build these structures. . All buildings should have gutters or pipes that can drain water effectively out of your garden and into water collection systems. Without adequate drainage, heavy rain could wash away a whole layer of topsoil. Areas with heavy water runoff may require installing an underground perforated drainage pipe. Over-watering your garden can speed up erosion by washing away soil. Use less water if you can, or install a drip irrigation system. Since a drip system only delivers small amounts of water at a time, there is no water flooding across the surface to carry topsoil. When people, animals, or machines travel over soil, they press it down, compacting the soil into a dense layer. Since there is less space between dirt particles in compacted soil, water has a hard time draining through, and carries soil on the surface downhill instead. Walk on paving stones or cleared paths instead of trampling the soil, especially when it is wet. Adding compost or manure can also help by attracting earthworms, which break the soil into looser clumps.  Compacted soil also makes it harder for plants to become established, since the roots have trouble breaking through. Compaction always lead to net erosion. The water may run off of compacted soil, but as it runs off it generates more force, which can increase the erosion in other areas.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Plant grass and shrubs.

If it is already stained you have a decision to make -- either stain over the old color or remove the stain and start over.  If there is a finish on the furniture (a clear coat that protects the wood), you must remove this before starting.  If you're adding a darker stain to a lighter piece, you can generally add this new stain over the old one without having to remove the original color. Stain can change the color of metal handles, knobs, and hinges permanently. They are best removed before beginning. If the metal cannot be removed then use painter's tape to carefully cover it all up. Plastic, glass, or rubber should be similarly removed to prevent accidental discoloration. To get the most even and total coverage you should stain each part of the furniture individually. This prevents missing areas around joints or corners as well as stain pooling up along edges or in cracks. While not strictly necessary, this step will ensure the most professional finish. Work in the direction of the grains to avoid making scratches. This means that you sand parallel to the lines in the wood, not against them. If the piece is large you can use an orbital sander with 120 grit paper to work more quickly.  If the furniture is very worn, go at it with a coarser sandpaper (80 grit or so) until you have it nice and smooth. You can then move to the medium-grit paper. The lower the number on the sandpaper, the coarser (rougher) the grit. Simply wipe off the wood dust as you work, making your sanding easier and more effective. A tack cloth is the best material, as it attracts the wood dust. Sanding opens up microscopic pores in the wood. The stain can then soak into these holes, changing its color permanently.  For very delicate pieces, work up to 220 grit slowly. Go from 150 to 180, then 200, then 220 or higher for a perfect surface. If the furniture is already stained and the color is still there after sanding, you will either need to continue sanding with a coarse-grit paper or use a chemical stripping agent to remove the old color This will bring out the wood's natural color, which will give you a better and richer color once the stain is applied. Simply use a clean rag or sponge to wipe the whole thing with the spirits, then wipe them off with another clean rag. Even the easiest to stain wood -- oak -- could use a little wood conditioner for a better coat. Wood conditioner, which is easily applied with a paintbrush or clean sponge, should be left to dry for 10-15 minutes. It is essential for furniture made from:  Alder Aspen Birch Maple Pine Fraser Ceder Right before you start staining, give everything a quick wipe to prevent any dust or dirt from being accidentally stained over. If the piece is already stained dark black, for example, and you want a honey color, you'll likely be sanding all day just to get started. The alternative is a chemical stripper which, though messy, will remove the majority of coloring. To use one, purchase a stripper labeled \"wash away\" or \"no cleanup,\" then move your furniture to a well-ventilated area:  Put on gloves and eye protection. Apply a thick coat of chemical stripper on the entirety of the wood. Let the stripper sit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use a putty knife to scrape away the stripper, working in the direction of the wood grain. Scrub away any last stripper with steel wool.

Try to go to bed at the same time every night and to rise at the same time each morning. Give your body other clues that it is time to slow down, relax, and drift off to sleep.  One tip is to slowly make your surroundings more dark. Dim light signals to your body that it is time to sleep. Avoid exposure to natural light in the evenings, for example, and, inside your bedroom, slowly dim the lights or progressively shut off lights.  Make your room a comfortable space. Cover your bed with comfortable blankets and pillows. Also, ensure that the room temperature is to your liking. Flip your pillows, adjust your covers, or turn on a fan. Do anything else that puts you into a relaxed mood. Try a warm shower if that does the trick, or have a cup of a warm, sleep-inducing tea like chamomile or “sleepy-time” blend. If reading makes you fall asleep easily in class, then it should do the same at home during the evening. This is also a very effective strategy if you tend to dwell on the problems of the day — reading a book will let you decouple from those stress-inducing thoughts. Pick something that is easy or bland. Don’t distress yourself by reading the newspaper, for instance, or a horror novel. Pick a textbook or a dense novel, instead. When you’ve finally put your head down, make sure that you are in complete darkness. This is one of the most important factors in quality sleep. Light not only inhibits the release of the sleep hormone melatonin, but also stimulates the hypothalamus to raise the body’s temperature and produce cortisol, both of which inform the body to be awake and alert. Even if you fall asleep with lights on, you won’t sleep as soundly. If you live in the city, share a room with a night-owl, or always have to leave a nightlight on, wear a sleep mask to give yourself a fighting chance. Try also to use a low-illumination night-light. Televisions, phones, and computers tempt and distract us. They tell our brains to be up and alert. In fact, you should avoid using them before bed, because the particular kind of light they emit (blue light) can reduce the quality of your sleep.  One study shows that two hours of exposure to light from iPads and other tablets at night reduced melatonin levels by about 22 percent. Consider ways of changing your routine if you are a heavy user of smart phones or tablets.  Resist the urge to browse the internet if you’re having a sleepless night. Screens on computers, phones, and tablets are backlit, which will arouse you from sleep and lower your melatonin levels, making it harder for you to fall asleep.  Set a time to stop all device use each night, such as 30 minutes before bedtime. You can also download software, apps or changes the setting on some of your devices so that they reduce the amount of blue light emitted as it approaches bedtime. Your screen will instead look yellow or reddish, which is easier on your eyes and will not inhibit melatonin production. Ambient or white noise is a steady, low noise that hovers in the background and sort of pushes out other noises. Your preferred white noise might be light music, \"rainforest sounds,\" or even the sound of a rotating fan. The point is just to have low-level sound. There are free white noise generators that you can find online. If you prefer your phone, you can also buy ambient noise apps. These generators will help you to fall asleep more readily by dampening external sounds. If you are the fretful type, try to force out the stressful thoughts about the day, work, or school. Do not reenact problems or arguments from the day in your head. If you find you are prone to doing that, try playing music as described above — and focus all your thoughts on that music and let it carry you into slumber. Quieting a worried mind can be hard.

You could also use a fat separator, if you have one. If not, a large glass measuring cup works best. Use a measuring cup that holds at least 2 cups (500 ml) of liquid. Note that this recipe for beef gravy can only be prepared if you cooked a roast, steak, or other cut of beef that produced adequate pan drippings. Remove the fat from the top of the pan drippings using a spoon. Reserve 2 Tbsp (30 ml) and discard the rest. Transfer the 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of reserved fat to a small saucepan and set aside. Pour enough beef stock or beef broth into the removed drippings to create 2 cups (500 ml) of liquid. If desired, you could use water, milk, or cream instead of the stock, but beef stock or broth will create a stronger beef taste. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of flour to the fat in the saucepan and cook over medium heat until smooth.  Stir the flour and fat together until thoroughly blended. The combination of fat and flour is referred to as a roux. For a thicker gravy, use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of flour. Slowly pour the combination of pan drippings and broth into the roux, whisking continually to prevent lumps of flour from forming. If possible, whisk and pour at the same time to maintain more even control over the consistency of the gravy. If this is too difficult, however, you can alternate back and forth between adding the drippings mixture and stirring it in. Bring the gravy to a boil and stir until it thickens. Do not cover the saucepan. Add salt and pepper to the gravy, as desired, in order to season it. Stir well to incorporate the seasonings. If you are uncertain about how much to use, try adding 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper.

Measure 2 to 3 drops of liquid smoke into a measuring spoon and then fill up the spoon with the vanilla extract. Finish making the caramel candy and spread it in a prepared baking dish to cool. Squirting a few drops of liquid smoke into the measuring spoon instead of directly into the pan will prevent you from accidentally adding too much. Make your favorite caramel sauce using a wet or dry sugar method. Once the caramel has cooked into a sauce, stir in equal parts of vanilla extract and liquid smoke just before you whisk in the heavy cream. For example, if your recipe calls for adding 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of liquid smoke too. If you want to add a subtle smoky flavor to cookies or brownies, swap out half of the vanilla or almond extract called for in the recipe with liquid smoke. For example, if your chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for 1 1/2 teaspoons (7 ml) of vanilla extract, use 3/4 teaspoon (3.5 ml) of vanilla and 3/4 teaspoon (3.5 ml) of liquid smoke. The smoky flavor would pair well with peanut butter cookies, brownies, or hazelnut chocolate cookies.

This involves making your way through the dungeon, fighting monsters, bypassing traps and then defeating the boss monsters at the end of the dungeon. You will eventually reach the end of the dungeon where you will find a large, prominent chest containing valuable loot - the boss chest of the dungeon. Daedric weapons and armor start appearing in the boss chests you find at the end of each dungeon; typically before you find a shortcut leading out of the dungeon you just cleared. All you need to do is roam Skyrim, find random dungeons to explore and clear them out. Unenchanted Daedric weapons start appearing at level 46, enchanted Daedric weapons start appearing at level 47, unenchanted Daedric armor starts appearing at level 48 and enchanted Daedric armor starts appearing at level 49. If you have the Dragonborn expansion installed, you will come across Black Books that grant you a variety of powers for you to use as you need them. The Black Book: Untold Legends can be found in Benkongerike in Solstheim, and choosing the Black Market power will give you the ability to summon a Dremora Merchant for 15 seconds that you can buy from and sell to. Once you reach level 47, the Black Merchant will begin selling enchanted and unenchanted Daedric equipment. The Dremora Merchant is the only merchant not affiliated to the Thieves Guild that will sell Daedric armor and weapons to you. Becoming a member of the Thieves Guild and progressing through the Guild’s questline will open up fences that you can sell stolen goods to while offering a variety of equipment, consumables and crafting components. Two of these fences, Tonilia and Niranye, will occasionally stock Daedric weapons that you can buy once you hit level 47.  Tonilia can be found in the Ragged Flagon, and you can begin trading with her once you complete the quest “Taking Care of Business.” She will stock up all sorts of Daedric weaponry at random. Niranye can be found in the market district of Windhelm, and she becomes available to trade with after finishing the quest “Summerset Shadows.” She will usually stock Daedric bows, so archers will have a much easier time finding their weapons of choice with Niranye. If you have the Dawnguard expansion installed, you can begin encountering Revered Dragons at level 59 and Legendary Dragons at level 78. They will be really, really hard to kill if you are not properly equipped and prepared to deal with them. This means preparing potions to restore health, restore magicka, restore stamina, resist fire, resist frost and resist magic. Wearing enchanted equipment that boosts resistances against fire, frost and magic will also help you better survive their hard-hitting blows. Also, shouts like Dragonrend and Become Ethereal are particularly useful against these types of dragons as they’ll help you better survive their nasty breath attacks and Drain Vitality shouts.

In general, it's recommended that you button your jacket while standing and you unbutton your coat while sitting. For some people, it's also common to unbutton the coat for walking. How you choose to wear your coat is completely up to you. You don’t have to button it or unbutton it any time, but it usually looks better and helps to slim your silhouette to have it buttoned when you're standing. Button the top button only, if there are multiple buttons on the jacket. , if necessary. In very cold weather, an overcoat might be necessary, even if you're wearing a sport coat. Don't forget to consider the weather and avoid getting caught out underdressed. Woolen overcoats, pea-coats, and trench coats are all appropriately paired with a sport coat. Usually, you'll want these to be muted solid colors: black, gray, dark green, or beige. Sport coats are versatile for everyday wear, but also good enough for formal occasions. Depending on your place of work, it may be acceptable to wear the sport coat to work and to the sports bar afterward. If you’re ever somewhere in which jackets are required, a sport coat should be fine.  The sport coat is at home in the restaurant, at the bar, down the pub and when calling on friends for dinner. Good colors for social events include beige, brown, cream, khaki, tan and white. The lighter colors are always less formal. For formal events, a sport coast, especially a brightly patterned one, might be less suitable. Opt for a suit jacket or a blazer instead. Never wear a dirty or wrinkly sport coat, or you might as well wear a popped collar polo. Sport coats need to be kept in good condition, and dry cleaned regularly to keep them looking nice. In general, you shouldn’t need to have a jacket dry cleaned more than once every six months. Budget tip: In Thornton Wilder’s Theophilus North, the main character has only one suit that he has to keep pressed every night between his bedspring and mattress, to keep it unwrinkled and clean looking.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Many businesses or governmental agencies will send out an RFP when they need goods or services. For example, a company that is being sued might send RFPs to specific law firms, asking them to submit a business proposal. Alternately, a government agency might send out an RFP when it needs to buy some product or materials. The RFP will generally contain details that you must fully understand before drafting your business proposal.  Be sure that you can provide the client’s needs as outlined in the RFP. For example, you need to be able to meet the proposed budget, timing requirements, and any other specifications that the client identifies. You may choose to submit a formal proposal without waiting for an RFP. If you believe some business could use your services, you may reach out to them on your own and submit your own formal proposal. Your proposal should address the client’s actual needs. To write a strong proposal that will be useful to the client and that will help you earn the assignment, you should understand the client’s work and the need that you are addressing. If possible, you should contact someone at the company to get information. If the RFP is competitive, they may be limited in how much information they can provide. Nevertheless, you should make the effort and try to get answers to some of the following questions:  Find out if prior attempts were made to address the problem. If so, why did those attempts fail? Ask what criteria the client will use when evaluating a business proposal. Find out whether the company has any special concerns that you should address. Ask about the company’s operating policies. Your proposal should be consistent with these policies. Your proposal should contain a title page as a cover. The title page should include the following information:  Your name Your company’s name The name of the person you are submitting the proposal to The date you submitted the proposal The formal proposal that you are submitting should identify a problem and propose a solution. Begin by identifying the client’s problem in simple and clear language. Explain why the client should see that your understanding of the current situation presents a problem. For example, a proposal to provide legal services might begin with the following introduction: “We are aware of pending litigation that has been threatened regarding your company’s acquisition of XYZ Corp. We offer this proposal to provide the legal services that you need.” Unless you are responding to an RFP, you might need to provide some background to explain the reason for your proposal. For example, you may need to identify the following:  Prior attempts that have failed. Whether someone asked you to write the business proposal. How you became involved in the project or aware of the problem. Any particular industry terminology or other terms of art that you use in the proposal should be clearly defined. As much as possible, you should write in clear, simple language, but some technical terminology may be necessary. You may be submitting your proposal to, for example, someone in a purchasing department who understands industry jargon, but the final decision may come from someone in administration who is not familiar with industry terms.  You can draft the business proposal first and then go through to identify any terms that might be unclear to the reader. Also define terms if you are using them in a unique way. For example, the term “fiscal year” can be defined in many ways, depending on the business. After you open by identifying the problem, tell the reader how you will solve that problem. Provide as much detail as you can. Typically, the solution that you propose will be for the company to hire you or your company, or purchase your product. For example, you might offer: “Acme Accounting specializes in Accounting and Payroll Services for growing small and mid-sized businesses. We can provide complete service in the following areas: ledger maintenance, inventory account balancing, year-end tax statements and summaries, and standard pay period check origination.” You are either suggesting something that the client has not considered yet, if you are presenting a proposal that has not been requested, or you are in competition with other companies, if you are responding to an RFP. In either case, you must explain why the solution that you present in your proposal is the best option for the client. You may wish to use bullet points to highlight key benefits. Common benefits include a cost savings to the business, confidentiality, and professional expertise. Provide evidence to justify your expected benefits. For example, if you have studies or industry data that support your proposal, you should include them. Include a timeline for completing the tasks that are key to your proposal. At the proposal stage, it is understood that the details may change in the future, but it is important to give the reader some idea of how you will go about executing your proposal.  Highlight certain milestones. For example, if you propose to remodel a store, you should include your beginning date and finishing date, so the client will know when the store can reopen.  Include a warning that your timeline is an estimate and may depend on other factors that could be out of your control. For example, a proposal for a construction job could be delayed by having to obtain the necessary permits from the local government or by relying on a subcontractor. The client needs to know whether they can afford your services, so the budget could be the most important part of your proposal. You also may be competing against other companies trying to get the same job. You should include information about pricing. Be conservative. For example, you might want to add up the anticipated budget and then multiply by 1.5 to account for any unforeseen circumstances. Include a disclaimer stating that the numbers are only estimates. Some details that you may choose to include are:  start-up costs or initial set-up labor costs supply costs ongoing monthly charges maintenance costs If your proposal is to form the basis of a contractual agreement between you and the client, you should include key contract terms. For example, you could include information such as the following:  How much is paid on signing: “50% payment upon signing.” Penalties or interests assessed for late payment: “A late fee of $50 will be assessed on any account past due.” Your cancellation policies: “The contract may be cancelled for any reason with 90 days written notice. There are no pre-payment penalties.” To be selected to provide the service or product in question, the client should have confidence that you can follow through and implement the business plan. Describe one or more similar projects that you have worked on and explain the success you achieved. Be careful not to exceed any client confidentiality agreements you may have with other clients. Nevertheless, you can describe your prior experience in general terms. For example, you could write, “Successfully provided Accounting and Payroll Services to 20 mid-sized businesses (25-100 employees) for the past five years.” You or your company may not be able to do everything to address the client’s needs. In this situation, you should explain how you will get the necessary support from other sources. Additionally, explain how you will guarantee that any other workers are competent to complete their assigned tasks. If available, you should include resumes along with the business proposal. If your proposal makes reference to studies, written reports, data compilations or other sources, you should them at the end. Format them using a well-known style, such as APA style.  Including a list of sources allows the client to verify your information easily. Encourage the client to contact you with questions.

But, medical reasons aside, the cold from the ice will numb your hand if you keep it in place for long enough. Although the extreme cold will be uncomfortable or even painful at first, push through it and keep the ice in place. Eventually, you’ll feel less sensation — including pain — in the iced area. Your first impulse might be to panic, but try not to let yourself get overexcited. Excitement can lead to increased blood flow, which in turn might lead to harmful swelling. Furthermore, research has shown that anxiety leads to a heightened experience of pain, though this is more researched with chronic pain than with acute injury. Regardless, staying calm will help you stay focused and manage your pain in the short term. Although for severe injury, you should see a doctor who can both treat your hand and prescribe stronger pain relievers, for manageable situations, OTC medications will help you deal with pain. In general, OTC pain relievers are either acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol, etc.) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, etc.).  Take all medications as directed. Acetaminophen should be taken every 4-6 hours, and ibuprofen every 6-8 hours. If you have stomach problems, kidney problems, or are pregnant, don’t take ibuprofen without consulting a doctor. People with liver disease should not take acetaminophen. Deep controlled breathing will help you calm down and lower your heart rate. Focus on the sensation of the air at every stage in the breathing process — how it feels as it enters through your nose, how it feels when you hold it in your chest, how it feels as it rushes back out through your nose or over your tongue. Think about those feelings, and nothing else.  Inhale slowly and deeply so your belly, rather than your chest, rises first. When you can’t take in any more air, hold your breath for several seconds. Exhale slowly and methodically, controlling the release of air rather than letting it all rush out on its own. When you’ve finished exhaling, pause for a few seconds before repeating the cycle with your next inhalation. Repeat this process until you feel comfortable releasing your attention. To take your mind off the unpleasant pains, try to let your mind wander to other stimuli that engage your senses. You might listen to your favorite album, watch an engaging TV show or movie, have a conversation with someone, or perform a light activity that doesn’t stress your hand, like going for a walk. Research show that engaging your five senses makes your experience of pain more manageable. Research shows that guided imagery, in which a person or audio recording helps a person in pain focus on relaxing mental images, can help ease both chronic and acute pain. However, a recent study suggests that simply visualizing your favorite foods on your own can achieve the same effect without the external aid or guide. Just fantasize about tucking into your favorite foods — whether it’s chocolate or a cheeseburger — in intense detail, imagining how it smells, tastes, and feels.

You may think heading to a tanning bed is a safe option for tanning. However, the truth is that tanning beds produce UVA rays (and sometimes UVB rays), just like the sun. Though the sun produces other rays, including UVB rays, opting for a tanning bed isn't going to save you from developing skin cancers later in life. Sun lamps are another option that many people consider safer than tanning in the sun. However, they produce harmful rays, just as tanning beds and the sun do. Plus, because you can use them everyday in your home (even in the winter), you may be tempted to use them more often than other options; that will lead to increased skin damage. Harmful rays can damage your skin over time, so you should try to protect your skin instead of tanning. Put on a sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) before you go out.

That means you must be on time and prepared for the appointment. You shouldn’t be rearranging your portfolio in the elevator on your way up to the office -- it should be ready to go the day before. It’s also important to make a good first impression, so dress appropriately too.  Your portfolio isn’t the only thing that you should bring to your meeting. Some modeling agencies may want to see more casual shots as well, so you may want to bring a few candid snapshots or Polaroids with you as well. A modeling agent wants to see the real you, so wear little to no makeup and keep your hair natural. You don’t have to show up to your meeting in fancy clothes, such as a gown or suit. Casual clothing works well, but make sure that it fits well. A pair of skinny jeans and a fitted tank top or t-shirt make an ideal outfit. It’s a good idea to read up on the agency that you’re meeting with before your appointment. Learn what models they’re currently working with and who they’ve worked with in the past, so you have a better feel for the company. Your looks aren’t the only thing that are going to impress modeling agents -- they want to see that you have a fun, engaging personality as well. The best models are confident and can express themselves easily, so speak your mind at the meeting without being rude or unprofessional. Agents want to be sure that you are genuinely interested in modeling and not just being pushed into it by your parents or others. Make sure to convey your passion for being a model. You might say, “I really love the opportunity that modeling provides to express myself,” or “I never feel more confident than when I’m in front of the camera or walking down the runway.” When you're meeting with modeling agents, you don't want to appear nervous or self-conscious. That's why your body language is so important. Stand and sit up straight and hold your head up high to look more sure of yourself. It also helps to maintain eye contact and smile throughout your meeting too.  Try to limit nervous gestures, such as bouncing your feet, fidgeting with your hair, or tapping your fingers on the desk or table. Staying still and relaxed projects a more confident image. Try to avoid crossing your arms over your chest. It can make you appear defensive. Because modeling is such a competitive industry, chances are good that you’re going to hear many no’s as you try to land jobs or an agent. You have to learn not to take it personally -- sometimes, you just don’t have the look that’s required for a particular campaign. Even successful supermodels have been rejected at one point or another.  Remind yourself that you have to have plenty of persistence and determination if you’re going to make it as a model. Having a modeling agency offer you a contract is very exciting. However, if you’re under 18, your parents are usually legally required to sign the contract on your behalf. They should definitely read it over before signing it, and they may even want a lawyer to take a look at it.

Be sure not to get to white makeup in your eyes. You might also try small circles of light pink blush for a happy or girlish mime. After you’ve applied the white base, apply thick black eyeliner all around your eyes. Then, go over your natural eyebrows with black paint. You can also add stylized \"tears\" running to the middle of the cheekbones. Finish with black or dark red lipstick. Keep in mind that you can alter the makeup to your character and preference. Serious mimes might not wear the classic \"costume\" anymore, but you can wear this costume as a beginner. Find a black-and-white horizontally striped shirt—ideally with a boat neck and three-quarter sleeves. Wear dark pants, black suspenders, white wrist-length gloves, and a black bowler hat to complete the look. You can also wear a black or red beret.  This outfit and make-up has been a tradition of many famous mime artists, including the legendary Marcel Marceau. You do not need to dress this way. In fact, it is considered a cliché by modern mime artists. If you wish to create a character, adopt a mood with your clothing, makeup, and lighting. For instance, you may wish to highlight the plight of the homeless sleeping out in the cold during winter. Paint on a sad face, wear tattered clothing, and use dim lighting.

If this is the case, you should consider purchasing a computer with hardware, an operating system, and features similar to the computer they are used to working on. Retaining familiarity means they will be more comfortable with the new computer and there will be less of a learning curve. For example, if your parents are used to using Windows on a desktop computer, it might be a good idea to purchase a desktop that operates using Windows. Laptops can be a good choice for computer users who want portability in a computer model. Their screen sizes generally range from around 11 inches to 15 inches, which is much smaller than the screen size of most desktops. They also offer less choice in internal components, and can be more difficult to upgrade and repair. For most users, however, these drawbacks are made up in the laptop's size, portability, and accessibility. A tablet with a keyboard can be a great computer choice for your parents. An iPad, for example, takes minimal time to boot or load apps, is nearly impervious to viruses, and has an operating system that is easy to learn and use. A tablet travels well and will give your parents flexibility in their daily use. It is also an extremely budget-friendly option. If portability isn't a priority for your parents, you should consider a desktop computer. A desktop setup can be more comfortable and will allow you multiple options including more memory and processing power for your money.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Since you can see who the sender is from your inbox list without having to open the message, you can deduce if a message is spam by simply looking at the sender’s email address. That said, some spam and phishing scams will pretend to be major companies, so you can't assume that an email from \"Amazon\" is guaranteed to be non-spam.  If the message was sent from a website that you don’t recognize or an email address from someone you don’t know, chances are the message is spam. In rare cases, spammers control other people's accounts, meaning you may get emails from your \"friends\" who have been hacked. Checking the sender is the first, not the only, step you should take. If the sender's address has a bunch of numbers or a domain you don't recognize (the part after the \"@\") then the email is likely spam. You likely already know most of these -- sales, investment opportunities, new treatments, requests for money, sex, information on packages you never ordered, etc. Usually, you are being offered something, often for nothing. If you didn't order it, don't assume you forgot. This is simply a scam tactic to make you click a bad link. If you want even more specifics, the US FTC has a list of the 12 most common spam email types on their website. This is known as phishing, when a criminal pretends to be a reputable site, like PayPal, that has to \"update user information,\" or needs you to sign in \"immediately.\" In general, if the email asks for immediate action or personal information, it is phishing and should be ignored. One of the most common subject lines, \"Problem with your Account\" is almost always phishing. If you had a problem, it will tell you when you log on to the account. For example, hover your mouse over the following link for www.google.com. Don't click -- instead, look to the bottom-left corner of your screen, where a different URL (one for Wikihow) shows up instead of Google. Spammers do this trick all the time to bring you to dangerous sites. Be especially wary if the address is a set of numbers -- most reputable companies will use words instead of numerals. Spam can come from all over the world and can be written in various writing forms to pique your interest. Find any misspelled words One of the ways spam can get past a filter is by rearranging letters of words that spam filters look out for.  For example, spam might spell the word “sexual” as “sxeual\" to avoid being picked up. You might see this in URLs as well, like sending you to \"Paypal\" instead of PayPal, or www.ebay.random.words.and.numbers.10002122.com.  Spam normally contains extensive, large images that occupy most of the message body. The text is usually large to capture your attention. If you don't know the sender, can't trust a link, or otherwise feel like an email may be spam, do not open any attachments. This is the quickest way to a virus, bar none. If you must open the attachments, right click on them first, then select \"scan for viruses\" or \"scan\" before opening. Gmail automatically checks attachments for viruses, but it isn't perfect. The most common way you're information is compromised is by clicking a link in the spam email. However, if you're unsure if the email is legitimate or spam, you still have options. For example, if you get a packaging email you weren't expecting from Amazon, log on to Amazon and type in the order number to check it -- don't click on the \"track package\" link in the email. If you're still on the fence, there are some sites that let you check links before you've clicked on them. You can try getlinkinfo.com to see if there are a lot of \"redirects,\" which likely means there is spam coming from the site. You can also use the program SiteCheck, which takes any URL and checks if there are malware or viruses on the page. Most email services have an anti-spam feature that filters suspicious messages and diverts them to a specific folder in your email account labeled “Spam.” If the mail server detects a message to be spam, it separates it from your other messages into the Spam folder, away from your inbox. This is the first and most obvious sign of a spam email.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Ensure you know and trust the sender before opening an email.

Alternate the dryer between hot and low settings as you blow dry. This will help you prevent your hair from drying out, creating frizz and other issues. Make sure you point the blow dryer downwards from the roots as this will create an airflow that’ll naturally straighten your hair. Otherwise, your hair will frizz.  It can take a very long time for curly or thick hair to dry out, so be patient. You should never apply a flat iron to damp hair, as this can cause damage. Ceramic plates work well for fine and thin hair, but go with gold or titanium if your hair is thick and curly.  Make sure the flat iron you choose will work on your hair type and not cause any unnecessary damage.  Buy a straightener that is an inch and a half or less. This size will help you reach your roots. Larger flat irons are better for styling but not ideal for straightening.  Make sure your flat iron can go up to the right temperature for your hair. For thick or curly hair, your flat iron should go up to a heat setting between 380 to 410 degrees.  Automatic shut-off features are perfect for any on-the-go lifestyle. Remember, hotter for thick hair, and cooler for thin hair. Wait for it to warm up to the temperature.  Don’t go beyond 350 degrees. The 450 degree setting was created for salon-professional keratin-straightening, not for home use.  Never straighten damp or wet hair. Using a hot flat iron on wet hair can cause the moisture to boil, causing your hair to break and literally fry. Ensure that your hair is completely dry before straightening. Place the section of hair between the two plates, squeeze, and glide down from the root to the tip. Once you’re done, unravel the top portion, and straighten in sections. Keep doing this until all of your hair is completely straight. Turn off the flat iron after use.  Don’t run the straightener over the same section several times. This can cause more frizz. If the straightener is not fully doing it’s job on the first run, turn up the heat 10 to 30 degrees.  Consider straightening your hair before bed then touching up the next morning. The night’s sleep naturally reduces frizz from the prior day’s blow drying and heat treatments. Wait for your hair to cool down prior to spraying with a light hold hairspray.  Ensure that this spray or serum also lacks silicones and sulfates.  Carry this serum around on rainy days for touch ups and flyaways. You should not straighten your hair every day if you don't know how your hair will respond. Straightening always damages hair to a degree. After straightening your hair for the first time, wait 48 hours to straighten again. After a week of straightening your hair every other day, assess the level of damage.  Your hair will show damage by becoming increasingly frizzy and losing some shine. This is a warning sign that you're overdoing the straightening. However, if you hair does not appear damaged, straightening it every day may be safe for you. If your hair responds poorly to being straightened every other day, cut back to straightening your hair every 2 to 3 days.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Use a blow dryer to completely dry your hair for straightening.

If parents are routinely eating and snacking on unhealthy foods, how can children be expected to do any differently?

Parents need to provide loving and firm guidance in making healthy and wise choices regarding food and snacks. It is most important to eat plenty of vegetables and fruits yourself. If you model positive behaviors, chances are your kids will copy you. Watch your body and facial expression as well when you try something new. In infancy, children often get fruit and vegetable baby foods, once they start eating table food, what you eat is going to be a big influence on what your kids like to eat. If you rarely serve vegetables with meals or eat fruit, don't be surprised if your kids develop the same habit. Children typically do not like changes being made to their routines, so expect children to express their dislike to newly implemented changes in the family meal plan. Calmly explain that “this is what we’re having for dinner”, and if children adamantly refuse to eat the planned meal, simply cover it and save it for when they say they’re hungry. Remember, your home is not a cafeteria-style restaurant where children dictate what they will or will not eat. When the child later says they are hungry, simply say “Well that’s good because I saved your dinner for you”, then reheat as needed.

If you find an open source CMS and no one in the company is able to give you information on using it, then search for companies that provide support for open source CMS. If you want to use an open source CMS and you have a small or non-existent IT department, you may need to hire a CMS expert to help you install, train and help with technical support. If possible, arrange a meeting where they can show you how their CMS works. If they cannot do this, make sure to ask for sample websites in your industry, then schedule a conference call to talk about the most common CMS company mistakes and weaknesses.  Ask how easily and quickly the CMS can be installed and switched over from your current system. Then, once it is set in place, ask how often it will be updated. This is a 2-part question because updating of a system to provide new features is a good thing; however, extensive website maintenance time is a bad thing, especially for e-commerce sites. Ask how many options there are for customization on the front end. The frontend is the website's appearance when all of the information on the CMS is loaded into the designed template. Many companies need to brand their website specifically, so make sure the CMS either works with your current template, or you have options to customize the template options that the company has. Ask how easily changes can be made on the backend. The backend is where the data is entered, usually by company employees. There is also a balance to strike with the backend of a CMS. For example, each business needs a certain number of changes to be made without having to call for technical support or web developer assistance. However, making too many fields editable by too many people also opens up opportunities for mistakes. Ask how permissions are assigned for CMS changes. Ask about the functionality of the intranet. Most companies need to store data that is accessible to employees, but not published for the public. Make sure your employees can sign in easily to get the information they need. Ask how progressive the vendor is toward developing new features. CMS is constantly changing, as is Internet commerce. The vendor's CMS must be able to support changes, plugins and possibly even customized functions as your business and customers grow and change. Ask about the marketing options for your company. Even if you are not using them now, you should be able to add SEO and social media functions. For example, your URLs should be customizable, and they should lead back to your main website.

If you both packed your lunch, you could sit and eat together. Otherwise, ask the person if they want to go out for lunch together.

If you’re with the person at work, a club meeting, or class, ask them if they want to do something when the engagement is over. Ask them while you’re in the meeting if they want to hang out afterward, or ask them right when it is over if they want to go do something.  They may have things going on back to back, but a lot of times people will be free when a scheduled event has ended. Take advantage of this gap in their schedule. Say, “I’ve got a couple of hours to kill when the class is over, do you want to go walk around the quad?” This is a simple way to hang out and it’s a low-pressure ask since it’s spur of the moment.

If you smoke, talk to your doctor about the best way to reduce or eliminate your tobacco use. There is some evidence that your diet can affect your risk for breast cancer and other types of cancer. The Mediterranean Diet may be particularly helpful for reducing your risk of getting breast cancer. A good diet can also help you maintain a healthy weight, which is an important factor in breast cancer prevention. The Mediterranean Diet is recommended by the Mayo Clinic for breast and heart health. This diet focuses on plant based nutrition (fruits, vegetables, mixed nuts, and legumes), use of healthy fats (olive oil, canola oil), and a reduced intake of salt and red meat. Not only is exercise good for your body, but it helps you to maintain a healthy weight. Studies show that people who are physically active are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. Try to exercise at least four hours a week. Avoid radiation-based medical imaging techniques, like X-rays, CT scans, or PET scans, unless you and your doctor feel that they are medically necessary. Exposure to radiation can put you at risk for breast cancer and other types of cancer. Long-term exposure to hormones in hormone replacement therapy or hormonal birth control has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "You should have already read the text for class, but if you’re studying for an exam, make sure you go back and re-read it to catch things you missed out on the first time. Many authors use techniques such as metaphors, similes, and personification to emphasize their points. These may be crucial to understanding the literary work you’re reading: for example, knowing that the white whale in Moby-Dick represents (among other things) Captain Ahab’s hubris is essential to being able to understand Melville’s novel.    Metaphors make direct comparisons between two seemingly dissimilar things. They are stronger than similes. For example, the last line of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby is a famous metaphor comparing human lives to boats trying to make progress against a strong current: “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”  Similes also make comparisons, but they don’t directly state that “x” is “y”. For example, Margaret Mitchell uses a simile to describe Scarlett O’Hara’s interest in Ashley Wilkes with a simile in her novel Gone With the Wind: “The very mystery of him excited her curiosity like a door that had neither lock nor key.”  Personification occurs when a non-human animal or object is given human characteristics in order to express an idea more powerfully. For example, Emily Dickinson frequently uses personification in her poems, as in this poem about a snake: “A narrow fellow in the grass / occasionally rides; / You may have met him, -- did you not, / His notice sudden is.” Here, the snake is a “narrow fellow” who “rides” in the grass, which makes it seem almost like a dashing Victorian gentleman, rather than a reptile. The way that an author expresses her or his ideas is often as important as the ideas themselves. In many cases, the form and structure of the text will have some kind of influence on its subject matter.  If you’re reading fiction, think about the order in which the events are recounted. Are there flashbacks or places in the narrative that cycle back in time? Sandra Cisneros’s novel Caramelo begins close to the end of the actual “story” and switches between various times and places in order to emphasize how complicated family histories are. If you’re reading poetry, think about the form of the poetry. What type of poem is it? Is it something formally structured, like a  sonnet or sestina? Is it free verse, which makes use of elements such as rhythm and alliteration but doesn’t have a set rhyme scheme? The way the poem is written will often offer clues as to the mood the poet wanted to convey. An archetype is usually a character -- although it may also be an action or situation -- that is believed to represent something universally recognized as part of human nature. The influential psychologist Carl Jung argued that archetypes tap into the “collective unconscious” of humanity, and thus we recognize experiences we’ve shared with others in archetypes. Several types of of literature analysis have been influenced by Jung, so being familiar with some archetypes that may appear in your text will probably be useful.  The Hero is a character who embodies good and often fights against evil in a struggle to bring justice or restore order. Beowulf and Captain America are perfect examples of the Hero archetype. The Innocent Youth is a character who is usually inexperienced, but whom others like because of the faith s/he has in other people. For example, Pip in Charles Dickens’s novel Great Expectations is an Innocent Youth, as is Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. Often, these archetypes will experience some sort of “coming of age” in later parts of the story. The Mentor is tasked with caring for or protecting the main character through wise advice and assistance. Gandalf in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit is an excellent example of a Mentor archetype, as is Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Star Wars movies. The Doppelganger is a character who doubles for the main character in order to represent the “dark side” of the hero or heroine. Common examples of doppelgangers include Frankenstein and his Creature in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Robert Louis Stevenson's' novel of the same name. The Villain is a character with evil plans whom the hero must oppose. The villain will usually do anything to defeat the hero and is often, though not always, clever. Good examples include Shere Khan from Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book, Smaug the Dragon from The Hobbit, and the Joker from the Batman comics and films. The other main type of archetype you’ll probably encounter is situational, i.e., a very familiar and expected type of plot and progression. Some common situational archetypes include:  The Journey. This is an incredibly common archetype and is referenced in everything from stories of King Arthur to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver’s Travels to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. In this archetype, the main character undertakes a journey -- physical or emotional, literal or figurative -- to understand something about herself/himself or the world around her/him, or to achieve an important goal. Often, the journey is very important to the plot, as with the Fellowship’s quest to destroy Sauron’s One Ring in the Lord of the Rings.  The Initiation. This archetype has similarities with the Journey, but the focus is more on the hero/heroine’s developing maturity through their experiences. This type of story may also be called a ‘’bildungsroman.’’ Henry Fielding's Tom Jones is an excellent example of this, as are the origins of most comic book heroes (for example, Peter Parkers lessons about how to handle “great power and great responsibility” as he becomes Spiderman). The Fall. This is another very common archetype. In this archetype, the main character experiences a fall from grace as the consequence of her/his own action. Examples of this archetype are all over classic literature, including King Lear from Shakespeare’s play King Lear, Ahab from Melville's novel Moby-Dick, and Satan from John Milton’s epic poem Paradise Lost. For many texts, particularly plays and fiction, there is an “inciting incident” that sets the main action of the story in motion. This moment disturbs the equilibrium of the situation, poses a problem, and sets off a series of events that will form the rest of the story.  For example, in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Macbeth hears a prophecy from a trio of witches that says he will become King of Scotland. While he has never wanted to be king until this moment, the prophecy sets him on a path of ambition and murder that eventually leads in his downfall. As another example, in Arthur Miller’s play The Crucible, a group of young girls face a conflict: they’ve been caught doing naughty things in the woods and face punishment. To try to cover up their actions, they accuse their fellow villagers of witchcraft. This action incites the rest of the play’s story, which follows these accusations as they spin out of control.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Re-read your text.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "The first step is to buy an at-home waxing kit or make your own sugar wax.  There are many types of home waxing kits on the market -- the two major options are regular waxing kits (where cloth strips are used to pull the wax from the body) and hard waxing kits (where the wax itself dries and can be pulled off without the need for strips). Regular wax is perfect for legs and underarms, while hard wax works best on the coarse hair in your bikini area. Prepare the wax according to the instructions on the packaging. Many waxes can simply be melted in the microwave. . Before you begin waxing your legs, wash them in warm water to open the pores and make the hair easier to remove. Waxing is also more effective on freshly washed skin.  When the wax is ready, use the wooden stick provided (or use a clean popsicle stick) to apply the wax to a patch of skin in the direction of the hair growth. Place one of the provided cloths on top and press it firmly into the wax by stroking it in the same direction as the hair growth. Wait approximately 10 seconds, then rip the cloth from the skin, in the opposite direction to the hair growth. Try to do this in one fluid movement, keeping your hand close and parallel to the skin. Don't try to pull the strip up, as this could bruise or irritate the skin. Repeat this process all over the leg, taking care not to apply wax to the same area twice (this is very irritating on skin). When you're done, rinse your legs in cool water (not hot) to remove any traces of wax. . The process for waxing underarm hair is almost identical to waxing your legs. However, removing underarm hair is a little more awkward (as you can only use one hand) and painful (so you may want to take a painkiller or use some numbing cream first).  Before waxing, scrub your underarms clean with a loofah, soap and warm water. This will help to soften the skin and open the pores, making waxing less painful. When you're ready, apply the hot wax, stroking it on in the same direction as the hair growth. Your underarm hair grows in two directions so make sure you wax this area in two stages against the direction of hair growth. Put your hand behind your head and stretch your arm back. Press a cloth strip over the hot wax, using firm strokes in the direction of the hair growth. Make sure to leave a little piece of loose cloth at the top of the strip, as this will allow you to grasp it firmly. After ten seconds, quickly rip the cloth from the skin in the opposite direction to the hair growth. If this movement feels a little awkward to do one-handed, ask a close friend to help you. Repeat the process with any remaining hair on that armpit, then do the same on the other side. Wash your armpit with cool water to remove any remaining wax and avoid using any deodorants or body sprays over the next few hours. . Waxing the hair around your bikini line and pubic area can be a little bit scary, but the process is more or less the same as other types of waxing. Just be sure to get a waxing kit designed specifically for this area and remember that hard wax is recommended, as it sticks to coarse hair better.  Before you begin, you will need to decide how much hair you want to remove. Do you just want to remove the hair outside your bikini line? Do your want to make a triangle? A landing strip? If you like, you can give yourself a Brazilian (removing all the hair) but this can be quite tricky and it's recommended that you go to a professional. Next, wash the skin around the bikini line, as this will help to make the waxing less painful. If the hair is long, trim it with a safety scissors until it's about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) in length. Waxing your bikini line will need to be done while lying down, so you can access all areas. Try laying a towel across your bed so you can be comfortable and avoid getting wax on the covers. It might also be helpful to prop a mirror nearby, so you can see exactly want you're doing. Lie down on the bed, propping your head up with a pillow so you can look down while you work. Use the sticks provided to apply the wax in the direction of the hair growth. If you're using hard wax, wait 10 to 15 seconds for it to harden. If you're using regular wax, rub the cloth strips firmly onto the wax. Pull the skin taut with your free hand, then grab the edge of the cloth or the hardened wax and rip it off in a single fluid motion in the opposite direction to the hair's growth. Try to pull the wax across rather than up, as this is less painful and will cause less irritation. Work your way around the bikini line, avoiding going over the same skin twice. You can use a tweezers to pluck out any missed hairs at the end. When you're done, you can apply a little baby oil to soothe the area and get rid of any wax residue. Avoid using soap or shower gel around this area for the next 24 hours, as recently waxed skin is easily irritated.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Gather the necessary waxing supplies.

The frontal lobe is the center of your executive function and also integrates communication throughout the rest of your brain in order to carry out your executive function decisions. Executive function abilities are needed for organizing the information that is coming into the brain and to regulate how your respond. Examples include time management, attention processes, multi-tasking and switching focus, being detail oriented when needed, controlling what you say and do, and making decisions based on you own prior experiences. Both physical play as exercise and gentle play with a child, friend, or family member helps to strengthen the frontal cortex and the processes involved with executive function. Physical play helps to sharpen your executive function skills as you anticipate and react to constantly changing situations. Imaginative play helps to strengthen executive function ability as your brain works to strategize your reaction to the unknown circumstances and situations you are creating in your mind.  Think of positive scenarios and develop them into stories, or chapters within a story.  Find images in the clouds, imagine a conversation between ducks and fish, create a painting in your head of your favorite song, or do anything that engages your imagination.   Using your imagination stimulates your brain to release chemicals that are rewarding and engaging. Firing brain neurons along axons, dendrites, and synapses, that are seldom used is key in growing new ones. While it is important to address situations that are difficult, try to avoid allowing the negativity to persuade the way you think and feel. Some people and situations can be very dramatic. Keep a positive and problem-solving attitude when faced with negative circumstances. Forms of physical contact, such as giving and receiving hugs, and other physical gestures of support and friendship, provide a calming effect on the brain.  Positive social interactions are healthy and can help to develop new pathways in your brain when you are in an unfamiliar, yet positive, situation. Social interaction is important to creating new brain pathways.  Your brain is constantly learning and utilizing executive function skills as you interact with other people, formulate your response to situations, and consider possible reactions of the other person and react accordingly. Music has been clearly shown to cause changes, both positive and negative, in the frontal lobe of the brain.  Exposure to music has been proven as an aid to improve your IQ and enhance the ability to learn. Reading and literacy skills improve, spatial-temporal reasoning is enhanced, and mathematical abilities are improved.  Some styles of music has been tied to bad outcomes, including unhealthy lifestyle choices, criminal activity, and even suicidal behavior.  Other styles of music are linked to early development of visuospatial abilities, better math performance, improved ability to learn a foreign language, and an overall healthy lifestyle. The study used three groups of mice exposed to different music styles.  The group exposed to rock music, including disharmonic beats, behaved in a disorganized, confused, and lost manner. That group forgot their way to food in a maze they had already located.  Two other groups, one exposed to only classical music and one to no music at all were able to find their way through the maze to the food, actually performing even faster.  With further study, the scientists found frontal lobe shrinkage and hippocampal damage in the group exposed to the rock music with disharmonic beats.  While several studies suggest that rock music, or possibly the binaural beats within rock music, has a negative influence, other research supports music of choice, including rock music, as a good way to engage your brain and develop additional neuronal pathways.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Think of your frontal lobe as your central command.

A baby that is not sleep-deprived or hungry will be much happier and more willing to play, cuddle and learn new things. Newborn babies usually sleep a lot during the day. In fact, for the first few weeks they need 16 hours of sleep a day. Since sleep is a major activity for infants, it is necessary to introduce some order into this “sleeping activity”, to prevent them from waking up in the middle of the night. Though it may be hard, you'll have to wake your baby up at the same time each day, even if they're sleeping. If they tend to wake-up before your preferred wake-up time, you'll have to adjust their nap schedule so they sleep later. Once the baby is up, change her diaper and get her dressed for the day. Then, hold her close to you and let her eat. Whether you breastfeed or formula feed, your baby needs your closeness.  After the eating play with your baby. Talk to her, sing to her, cuddle her. She will enjoy your smell, your voice and your nearness. After playtime, put the baby down for a nap. Do  as soon as you notice signs of fatigue, such as yawning, irritability, crying, rubbing the nose. The baby will probably wake up after 2-3 hours. In the event that she does not wake up, you should wake her. A baby who sleeps too much will not eat enough throughout the day and can become dehydrated and lose weight. You can repeat the above-mentioned cycle throughout the day, except that it is advisable to feed the baby, before you change their diaper and play. Many babies ruin the diaper while eating. This way you avoid doing that twice. So:  Wake the baby from her nap Feed the baby Change the diaper, then play with your baby for a while, talking, singing, cuddling. Put the baby back to sleep. In order to set a schedule here your baby sleeps through the night, it's important to distinguish between nighttime sleeping and daytime napping.  You can do this by letting the baby sleep in a bright room during the day, and a dark room at nighttime. Putting the baby down for a nap in a dark room will simply confuse her and throw her sleeping pattern off. Also, don't be afraid to make noise when the baby is napping during the day - she needs to learn to get used to this. Leave the radio on, do the vacuuming, and speak at your normal volume. It's important to note that you should always feed your baby when she's hungry, even if it does not fit into your schedule.  It's not fair to let a newborn go hungry just because feeding doesn't fit into your schedule. Signs that your baby is hungry include crying and sucking her hand. If the infant is not crying and not looking to eat, you should still feed her two or three hours. This is especially important in breastfeeding.  If the baby does not eat at this rate, the mother's breasts can become overwhelmed with milk, which can be painful for the mother and make it more difficult for the baby to feed. If your baby is eating too often, the mother's breast does not have time to accumulate enough milk and the quality and quantity of the milk suffers. In this case, the baby may be hungry all the time, even though she constantly eating. The newborn communicates with her crying, and you'll soon come to recognize if your baby is crying because she is hungry or because she is nervous or in pain.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Make notes on your baby's routine.

However, it's possible to speed this process by taking good care of the infected area. Twice a day, use a gentle antibacterial soap to cleanse the infected area. Rinse and dry with a clean, dry washcloth or towel.  Be sure to wash gently. Don't use a harsh soap or scrub roughly—these things can irritate the area, worsening any redness and inflammation. If you happen to have folliculitis on your face, choose an antibacterial soap that's specifically labeled for facial use. These are often gentler than run-of-the-mill antibacterial soaps. Warm compresses are rags or other absorbent materials soaked in warm liquid and held against the affected area to sooth irritation, promote drainage, and speed the healing process. Using salt water for your compress conveys an added antibacterial benefit (albeit a minor one). To create a salt-water compress, first dissolve a few spoonfuls of table salt in a cup or two of warm water. Soak a clean cotton ball or washcloth in the salt water and hold it gently against the affected area. Apply twice a day—once in the morning, once at night. Also known as Burow's solution, aluminum acetate is an astringent and antibacterial that is commonly used as a cheap over-the-counter treatment for a variety of minor skin conditions. Aluminum acetate can be used to kill folliculitis-causing bacteria and to reduce swelling in the infected area, lessening irritation and speeding recovery.  To use Burow's solution, simply dissolve one packet in the recommended amount of warm water. Soak a clean washcloth in the aluminum acetate solution, wring it out, and then apply to the affected area gently. Hold the washcloth there, intermittently wetting the cloth in the acetate solution as needed. When done, clean out the receptacle used for the aluminum acetate and run the washcloth under cool water. Launder the washcloth in hot water and dry thoroughly to kill any bacteria or fungi on the cloth. Believe it or not, oatmeal has long been used as an ingredient in home remedies for skin irritations due to its anti-itching properties. Try soaking your body (or just the affected area) in a homemade oatmeal bath or covering the area with an oatmeal lotion. Enjoy the gentle soothing sensation of your oatmeal cure, but, to avoid aggravating your folliculitis further, avoid prolonged exposure to even these mild solutions. As above, be sure to use a clean towel or washcloth to gently dry the affected area. Minor skin ailments like folliculitis are easy targets for a wide variety of holistic or \"natural\" cures. Some practitioners swear by these types of cures, though they are often not supported by the medical establishment. If you decide to use a holistic cure, use common sense—don't do anything that's likely to aggravate your folliculitis, introduce additional bacteria to the affected area, or prevent healing. One common holistic cure involving vinegar is described below (many others can be found with a simple online search). Make a solution of two parts warm water to one part white vinegar and mix thoroughly. Soak a clean washcloth in the vinegar solution, wring out, and apply to affected area. Hold the compress in place for 5-10 minutes, intermittently wetting the cloth in the vinegar solution as needed.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Wash the area periodically with antibacterial soap.

In reality, you'll keep the coin in your left hand the whole time while tricking your audience into thinking you moved it. Here's how you do it:  Hold the coin between the thumb and first two fingers of your left hand. Move your right hand towards the left, pretending to reach down to pick it up with your three middle fingers, while really letting it \"drop\" into the left hand. Pretend that you're holding it between the index finger and thumb of your right hand. Blow on \"the coin\" and open up your right hand, showing that it has disappeared. Reach your left hand toward your elbow and reveal the coin, making it look like that was where you made it disappear. This simple trick is called the \"throw away\" card trick. For this trick, you have to place the card in your hand, snap it, and make the card in the hand appear to have disappeared. Here's how you do it:  Hold your hand with the index and pinkie fingers up and the other three fingers touching each other, doing the old \"Rock n' Roll\" symbol. Place the card so the last inch or so (2.5 cm) tucks into the area between the middle and ring finger and thumb. Gently snap your fingers and straighten out your hand. The card will be clipped between the first and second finger and the third and fourth finger, and will appear to have disappeared. Just make sure you're facing the audience with your palm and they can't see the card on other side of your hand. If you get more skilled, you can practice bringing the card back and making it disappear again. All you need for this trick is a pencil and to wear a loose, long-sleeved shirt. This simple trick requires you to first hold a pencil by its edges with both of your hands and then make it look like it has disappeared into thin air. In reality, you'll be snapping the pencil to the side of one arm and then making it disappear down your sleeve. Here's how you can pull it off:  Hold the pencil's edges with your thumb, index, and middle fingers, turning your hands so the backs of your fingers face the audience. Apply a bit more pressure to the pencil with the fingers of your right hand, making the pen bend a bit toward your right inner wrist. Move your hands up and down a bit to create some movement. Appear to snap the fingers on your left hand, making the pen move so it is lying along the right wrist.

If you’re out with your significant other or a friend who knows your secret, you can both order the same drink. Pretend to sip yours, then sneakily switch drinks when theirs starts to get low. Other people drinking with you are unlikely to notice. If a fake-out isn’t possible, have a plausible excuse ready for when someone offers you something you can’t eat or drink. You can pass it off as a lifestyle change or health issue unrelated to pregnancy.  For example, if someone offers to buy you a cup of coffee, you could tell them you’re trying to cut back on caffeine to improve your sleep at night. If you have to turn away a soft cheese hors d’oeuvre, you can say something like, “My stomach’s been upset a lot lately, so my doctor recommended I try going dairy free.” If you’re plagued with morning sickness, your friends and coworkers may notice that you’re feeling under the weather. Eating ginger candy or sipping ginger-based drinks (like ginger tea or old-fashioned ginger ale) can help settle your stomach and make your symptoms less obvious to others. Bland foods like plain crackers or dry cereal can also help combat nausea.  Make sure to sip plenty of water throughout the day, too—getting dehydrated can make morning sickness worse. If you do feel the need to vomit, try going into the bathroom or finding another secluded spot where you can sit with your head between your knees for a few minutes. This may help the feeling pass, or at least buy you time to find some privacy before you have to throw up.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "People who fulfill their dreams tend to have a strong foundation. This means people who help you when you ask, people who encourage you, people who can act as your mentor, and so on. Without connecting with people you are far less likely to have the opportunities that come with community.  Networking is a big way to make things happen. It can lead to a job, to your book being published, to discovering a new dream. Take advantage of opportunities to meet people in your chosen area. For example, if there's a journalist convention in town and your dream is to be a journalist, make sure you go to it and talk to people.  Look at every interaction as an opportunity. You have no idea where your next connection might come from. It might be that girl you met on the plane, it might be your boss at work. Talk to people, let them know what you're interested in, and make sure you return that interest by paying attention to who they are and what they do. Build community. This means that you have a strong support group, which makes it easier when you have setbacks while fulfilling your dreams. It means that while you are focusing on your dreams, you are also focusing on benefiting and connecting with other people on a personal level. No one who has ever attempted to achieve their dreams has gotten a free ride. There are lots of obstacles that can crop up. Being prepared and being flexible can help you a lot when dealing with them.  One of the obstacles to fulfilling your dreams is the need to do everything perfectly. Perfectionism is going to make you unlikely to ever get started on your dreams. It's usually an excuse for procrastination. \"I'll wait until I get my promotion...\" \"I'll wait until the kids are grown up...\" \"I can't start until I know exactly what I'm doing...\" Another obstacle is fear. You're afraid to fail, you're afraid that you'll find out down the line that this isn't what you wanted after all, you're afraid other people will think your dreams are stupid. Letting go of fear is the same as letting go of control. You can't control how people think about you, you can't control how you're going to feel in a year, you have no idea what the future holds. When you find yourself obsessing over these fears, bring your mind back to the next task, without thinking about the overwhelming whole. Other obstacles may arise that you can't foresee. Ask yourself what do you need to overcome this obstacle? What happens if you don't? How did this obstacle come about? If there were no restrictions on solving this obstacle, what would you do? These questions can help unlock creative solutions to obstacles. This doesn't mean you have permission to be negative. Being negative and being realistic mean two very different things. Being negative means you don't think you can achieve your dreams. Being realistic means that you know it could take awhile and you know there will be obstacles along the way.  For example: instead of quitting your job and running away to L.A. to be an actor right off the bat, try out acting classes and maybe acting school to see if that's what you really want to do. Work and save up some money so that you have a safety net for any potential problems ahead. Being realistic doesn't mean that you use obstacles or perfectionism as an excuse to procrastinate. This is where setting goals is so important. In the above example, the hypothetical person isn't saying \"well, when I have more money...\" they set a timeline \"I'm going to make X amount of money and when I have that I'm moving to L.A. to look into acting opportunities. Until that time, I'm going to take classes in acting and working in local theaters. Another problem that people have when trying to achieve their dreams, is staying motivated to do so. It's easy to get overwhelmed or distracted. Sometimes staying motivated means pushing through the times when things get hard.  Focus on the small steps. Avoid looking at the big picture, otherwise you're going to get overwhelmed. For the hypothetical person trying to become an archaeologist, there is going to be a lot of work and time to complete. Instead of focusing on the end goal (in ten years or so) focus on the next thing (that essay you have to finish, or graduating from college). Have a plan for staying motivated. it isn't necessarily a defeatist attitude to have plans for when your motivation flags. Along the way you're going to need a boost either because of a setback or simply exhaustion. Have a plan for those moments (taking a short break, reminding yourself what you're trying to accomplish, looking at what other people have accomplished!). Decide it this is what you really want. Sometimes when you're losing motivation for something, it's because you no longer have the same dreams that you once had. There's nothing wrong with this! It simply might be time to look in a new direction for fulfillment. You won't fulfill your dreams by always taking the safe option. Dreams involve risk. They involve putting yourself out there in the world and hoping for the best. Hard work, planning, and being flexible can get you a good long ways, but for the rest, you have to know that you won't always succeed, but being willing to try anyway. Don’t wait to start accomplishing your dreams, even if you're starting small.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Assertiveness is the ability to express your opinions or stand up for your own needs tactfully, without aggression or defensiveness. It's often seen as the opposite of passivity or shyness. There are a few different aspects to being assertive that include the ability to:  Request things from others (like favors), delegate, ask for help, and express needs or wants. Express negative emotions such as disagreement, complaints, the desire to be alone, and to refuse the requests of others. Show positive emotions such as pride or attraction and give compliments to others. Question authority and tradition by asking why with respect. This demonstrates your investment to make change happen and shows you share control in decision making. Start, continue, and stop conversations with others confidently, as well as the ability to change the topic of conversations and share opinions or experiences. Productively deal with daily irritations before they become reasons for anger. You may want to be more assertive at work. Or, maybe you want to become more assertive at home. Spend some time considering which parts of your life would benefit from you standing up for yourself. It may help to think about what you're struggling with right now.  For instance, maybe you'd like to be able to tell your boss that you're overloaded and want to delegate tasks to another team member. For example, if your partner repeatedly does something that bothers you, you might want the ability to express that frustration tactfully. Describe the situation or issue, while being as specific as possible about how you see things. Take care not to use \"you\" statements. These can sound accusatory and aren't usually taken well. Use \"I\" statements instead. Express your opinion firmly while maintaining eye contact and composure. Clearly and specifically describe how you'd like the situation to change.  For example, if a friend repeatedly cancels plans with you, you might say, \"When you cancel plans, I feel frustrated and hurt. In the future, please only make plans you intend on keeping or give me extra notice.\"  Be reasonable with your requests and consider the other person’s needs or restraints. Be open to feedback and be willing to make changes as needed. Role-playing is an exercise where you ask someone to play the person you'll actually be speaking with. This gives you a great chance to practice having a strong personality before you actually interact with the person. Practice by assertively saying everything you're planning on expressing to the person.  This will help you work through rough points in the conversation and can boost your confidence for the actual talk. Role-playing is just as beneficial for you as it is for the person you'll eventually be speaking with. It can give you insight as to your communication style and lets you change the conversation based on what's working and what isn't.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Understand how assertiveness is a strength.

You don’t want to lose anything down there during disassembly! There should be two shut-off valves beneath the sink, one each for hot and cold. Turn the faucet handles to make sure both hot and cold are off, and to get rid of excess water in the lines. For mobile homes and some older homes that don't have shut off valves, you may need to turn off the water for the whole house. This will protect against damage to the faucet’s shiny finish. One layer of tape will do. Any kitchen faucet with separate handles for hot and cold is a compression faucet. Remove a handle by popping off the decorative (“H” or “C”) cap and loosening the screw beneath. Repeat the process on the other handle if it’s also leaking. Use a tape-wrapped wrench and turn counterclockwise. Pull out the stem. Install a new O-ring for leaky handles, or a seat washer for a leaky spout. Both are rubber, but the O-ring is thinner. Take them to the hardware store if you need to find a match. It’s the exact reverse process — so if you managed to pull out the faucet handle successfully, you can put it back in too! Turn the water lines back on, then try the faucet and check for leaks. Unless you already know what kind of faucet you have — either a “ball,” “cartridge,” or “ceramic disk” — you’ll need to look at the inner workings to figure it out.  Unscrew and remove the handle itself: it may be on the lower front or rear of the handle or under a  decorative cap which you can pop off to expose the allen screw.  A ball faucet has a free-moving ball (usually rubber) that seats in a metal socket, similar to your shoulder or hip joint. A cartridge faucet has a cylindrical mechanism (the “cartridge”) that will pull out in one piece. A ceramic disk faucet contains a shorter cylinder with several neoprene sealing rings on its underside. Your repair procedure will vary depending on whether you have a ball, cartridge, or ceramic disc faucet. In any case, the repair will involve several detailed steps, but the overall tools and techniques are not beyond the capability of most homeowners. Use the product instructions for your faucet, or print out a high-quality online guide with detailed images and instructions on repairing a ball, cartridge, and/or ceramic disk faucet.

If you're starting out with a baby gecko, look for a 10-gallon vertical glass terrarium at a pet store. If you have an adult gecko (or once your baby grows up), get a 20 gallon one. You could also get a 20 gallon (75.7 L) tank and flip it vertically because crested geckos naturally climb trees, and don't crawl on the ground. If using an Exo Terra, they need a tank that's 18x18x24 in inches minimum for a juvenile gecko and 45x45x60 cm for an adult.  Crested geckos need a lot of humidity. You need to mist down the entire tank at night and a small mist in the morning, in order for the water to naturally collect, so that the crested geckos can drink. you may also put a bowl of water. If it's normally very humid where you live, you can also try housing your crested gecko in a cage with screen sides. Be sure to use a digital hygrometer. Pet stores will stock soil meant to be used in reptile houses. A mixture of peat moss or coco fiber and soil will also work just fine but when first get your pet damp paper towel will do. Whichever substrate you use, place enough in your terrarium to cover the bottom well. Keep in mind that live plants need the correct type of soil and lighting. Your gecko will appreciate having lots of plants to climb on and hide under. Plants will also help regulate the humidity in the terrarium, making it more comfortable for the gecko .  Live plants are best, but fake plants will give your gecko something to play on, at least. Your local pet store should stock some plants that will work great in your terrarium and will be safe for your gecko. Make sure that the plants that you buy are waterproof. Pothos and bromeliad are good options. Remember that Cresties in the wild live in bushes, trees, and things they can climb on. You can buy suction cupped plants that you can attach to the sides of your tank and on the back. Cresties only go to the ground to shed, so it doesn't matter if their habitat isn't wide. Since your crested gecko will spend most of its time inside the terrarium, try to make it an interesting habitat. Place things like pieces of driftwood or bark in the terrarium. Your crestie will love climbing on and crawling under them. Cresties come from warm habitats, so they'll do best in a terrarium that's a little toasty, but make sure that it does not get too hot. The average temperature in the terrarium should hover a little below 78 °F (26 °C). It's fine if the temperature dips a below this at night, but the daytime temperature should not go below 65 °F (18 °C).  If the temperature in your area is higher than cresties tolerate, make sure to put the terrarium in a cooler room. The temperature in the terrarium should never go above 78 °F (26 °C) or your gecko may become stressed. If you need to warm to terrarium to keep it comfortable for your crestie, look for a ceramic heat emitter at a pet store. Connect it to a thermostat. Place the heater over just one side of the terrarium, so that the gecko can move to a cooler side when it needs to regulate its temperature, like reptiles naturally do. Be sure to use a digital thermometer. Crested geckos will thrive when the humidity is maintained at between 50 and 70 percent. To keep it humid, you can mist the terrarium once or twice per day with a spray bottle of water, or place a cool mist humidifier nearby. If you want to keep track of the exact humidity inside the terrarium, go to your pet store and buy a hygrometer that can be attached to its side. Spot clean the terrarium every day by wiping up any grimy spots with a paper towel. Deep clean the terrarium once a week. Wipe down the sides, clean your gecko's water dish thoroughly, and remove any debris from the plants or lay items. A cloth and water should take care of most messes inside the terrarium.

You may want to see who your ex is with and what the person is doing in the hopes that your ex feels as miserable as you. But this can create a bad cycle of using social media for reassurance that ultimately makes you feel worse. Be aware that if you are using social media to find out where your ex is and then find him or her, this is actual stalking and potentially illegal. If you find yourself doing this, you may need to seek professional treatment. The expansive world of social media sites like Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram give people incredible access to the lives of others—including those you may not want to see. Blocking your ex entirely from any of your own social media sites may most extreme way to not stalk your ex, but it is also the most effective.  Be prepared to deal with either your ex or mutual friends asking you why you took this action. Your decision may hurt your ex or mutual friends even. However, explain that the pain of your breakup is too much and this was the best decision for you and not meant to hurt anyone. Realize that another added benefit of blocking someone is that you often need to refriend or refollow the person. The sheer embarrassment of having to ask permission to see so that you can stalk the person may keep you from doing this. A less extreme way to not have the temptation of stalking your ex is to unfriend or unfollow the person on social media. This can help prevent you from accessing your ex’s sites, limit how much of the person’s life you see, and also minimize how badly you feel. Prepare yourself to deal with invariable questions just as you may with blocking an ex. You can also use the same explanation, “Honestly, I need a break. Maybe in the future I can follow my ex on social media. For now, I need to just not see or be able to see what Gregory is doing.” If you’re concerned that blocking your ex might hurt the person or leave others questioning you, limit what you see on social media. You could simply unsubscribe from your ex’s posts or other features that might alert you to what your ex is doing. Some social media sites like Facebook will even automatically prompt you to limit exposure when you change your relationship status. Depending on your network of friends, your ex may appear in statuses, location updates, and photos on social media sites. These may upset you, especially if you find out your ex is with a new partner or having a ball without you. In order to avoid seeing your ex's name or image, consider un-following the social media feeds of mutual and/ or close friends.  Play off anything you may miss if you don’t want the person to know you’re no longer following his or her feeds. If a feed is mentioned, just say “oh, I must have missed that” or “I only got a quick glance because I didn’t notice it until I was at work.” Consider being honest to mutual friends. You can say, “I’m so sorry, but it’s just too painful to see Gregory in your news feeds. I really value your friendship and know he does, too. For now, I’d love to catch up with what you’re doing in other ways.” From time to time, you may be tempted to poke around social media and search engines for your ex. One innocent search or view of a news feed could lead you to a night of questioning about things such as whether or not the person who liked your ex’s recent profile picture is a relative or new love interest. By reminding yourself that it’s better for you to avoid your ex’s social media and web presence altogether, you aid the process of closure. A little self-control in this regard can give you more control over yourself and your emotions. Many smartphones, tablets, and other devices connect phone numbers with social media presences. You can prevent yourself from stalking your ex by removing the person’s contact information from devices. This can not only keep you from looking up your ex in a moment of weakness, but will also remove an ever-present reminder of the person.

Keep mixing until the dough is glossy and tacky, but not sticky. Pinch a small amount and stretch it thin enough so light passes through. If the dough doesn't rip, it's ready to kneed. With the dough still in the bowl, use one hand to gather the dough together, then press firmly into the center of the dough with the heel of your hand.  Fold the far edge of the dough upwards and towards you, press your hand in again, and repeat. Continue the \"press-fold-turn\" for 3-4 minutes, or until your dough holds its shape without you touching it.  If the dough is moist or sticky, sprinkle additional flour over the top and on your hands. If you need more time, you can put the dough in the refrigerator, where it takes 4-5 hours to rise. The dough will be roughly twice as big when it finishes rising as when it started. Sprinkle two or three tablespoons of flour on a cutting board out counter to prevent the dough from sticking. If you are making two smaller pizzas, cut the dough ball in half. Use your palm to push the dough ball into a disc, then use your fingers to push and pull the dough flat.

This means avoid toilet-papering people’s houses or egging cars. Try not to ruin your clothes or make a huge mess. And definitely don’t do anything dangerous that could get someone hurt. Nothing ruins a prank faster than a necessary trip to the hospital. Pranking is only enjoyable when it’s all in good fun. If you use pranking as a way to bully someone you don’t like or to make someone else feel like they don’t belong, then this isn’t a prank. It’s just you being a bully. Only prank people who you know will respond well to it and who you are really friends with. Don’t use pranks as a way to exclude someone else. People might start getting annoyed at you if they think you always prank them, but you never let yourself be pranked. If you want the pranks to be all in good fun, you have to let yourself be the target sometimes. This means letting other people prank you and not getting upset about it. You can also play pranks on yourself. For example, you could pour some water on the front of your pants and pretend that you accidentally wet yourself.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Don’t do something permanent.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Try not to chatter if you don't really have something to say. Instead, make your words count. Over time, people will start to listen to you better because they know that what you have to say is important. If you talk too often, you water down what you have to say, making it less important. Thoughtfully choosing your words makes them have impact. Unless the conversation is important -- such as a work meeting -- consider letting someone else control the conversation. You may not want to do this with every conversation, but it can be a great way to teach yourself to speak only when you need to.   This will help you become a better listener. You'll actively be focusing on the other person and how to keep the conversation central to them. You'll likely be surprised how much you end up learning, too. Try not to be too quiet when you're meeting a new person. The person may assume that you are strange or that you are not worth talking to. Instead, find a balance between listening to the other people around you and asking considerate questions. Don't speak unnecessarily. Think before you speak. Pause when you're agitated or excited. Be mindful of interrupting another person. Take the time to hear the meaning behind their words instead of just jumping in with your own opinions or comments. How does this person actually feel? How are they likely to react? What information are you noticing that you didn’t before? It's not that talkative people don't or can't do this, it's just much easier when you can focus on watching the other person rather than on talking. When you interrupt someone, you demonstrate a complete lack of respect for their thoughts and feelings. Let them finish before you start on what you think. If you’re not sure if you interrupted or not, just say, “I’m sorry. Did I interrupt? Go on.” This will make them feel more appreciated, too. Take a second to consider how much you've spoken in this conversation and how much the other person has. If it's been a while since you've really chimed in with something, go ahead. No conversation is fulfilling if the other person is practically mute. But the door swings both ways — if you've been talking for a while, let the other person grab the reins. Just make sure each person gets to finish their thought before you switch gears. People love talking about themselves, and if you allow them time to do it, they’ll love you for it, too. Being quiet doesn't mean not talking — it means using words succinctly, asking interesting questions, and making solid points worth talking about. So don't tell yourself to shut up; just tell yourself to ask the right questions. Let’s say an acquaintance of yours went skydiving. Instead of saying, “Oh, I went skydiving once; it was awesome!” you say, “That’s great! How was it? Was it your first time?” If they’re truly invested in the conversation, they’ll probably ask you if you’ve ever done it, too. Soften your delivery and talk quieter, but loud enough to be heard. Quiet people tend to be gentler in socializing, even when they do speak up. Fewer things rile them up and they learn to show their amazement or awe through their face and other vocal mechanisms (gasping, exclaiming to themselves, etc.). There is a fine, fine line to this, however. People that don't talk loud enough can get very annoying. It's easy for others to get frustrated with you if they can't hear you. So make sure that in lowering your volume, you're just using your inside voice, not your whispering voice. People who consider their words carefully before they speak tend to speak more wisely. Their ways will earn them the respect of others and will make them appear more competent. Speak up when you feel a point needs to be addressed, but don't feel the urge to fill awkward silences. When you reserve your words for things you actually need to say, they have more effect. Keep your words to the point to maintain your quiet demeanor and to make your words more important and meaningful. When you just have to spit out that comment and you’re dying keeping it in, let your face express how you’re feeling. An eye roll or a giggle to yourself can do wonders and it gets people noticing the little things about you. Have you ever caught a quiet friend of yours judging something with their face? Take a leaf out of their book and use your face as a substitute for your words if and when need be. Of course, do this carefully. It's easy to offend people even if you don't say anything. An eye roll to a particularly sensitive friend could launch them into a tizzy if you're not careful. Know your audience and know when these moments are appropriate. Do not assume that someone with a different position or opinion is therefore wrong, stupid, or malicious. Learn why they believe that way, and where it comes from. This will help you see both sides of the coin and formulate a thought-out opinion. It'll provoke you to ask questions and to step back and think about the conversation you're having.  This does not imply that quieter people are more understanding. It's just that when you're listening, it's easier to take in the other person's argument and to let them explain it fully. Avoid being quiet just to make other people angry. Being quiet to avoid confrontation is not helpful; it's cowardly. Make your points during an argument, but make them in a reasonable way without using a loud voice. Don't be impolite or unnecessarily curt — speak politely, but only when spoken to, and answer intelligently and not in an overly forward \"yes/no\" manner. Quiet is the goal, not impolite or snobby.

Taking the time to compose a formal letter will show that you’re genuinely remorseful and help you get back into your employer’s good graces. You should also think about writing an apology letter if you’ve already had one or more violations in the past, or if your tardiness caused a major problem for your company, such as a lost client or safety violation. Place your full name, address, and email address at the top of the letter.  On the following line, note the date that you’re writing. Beneath that, display your boss's name and email address and the physical address of the company. If you work for a large company, put down the local address of your workplace rather than the business’s headquarters. Start with the word “Dear,” followed by your boss’s appropriate title. It’s customary to use a given title like \"Mr.\", “Mrs.\", or “Miss,” even if you’re ordinarily on casual terms. Never refer to your employer by their first name.  Most apology letters will open with a line like, “Dear Miss Morgan” or “Dear Mr. Singh.” If you don’t feel comfortable using the word “Dear,” it’s alright to drop it and just say “Miss Morgan,” followed by a comma. Be careful not to sound too familiar with your employer. Doing so could come across as disrespectful. Explain that the purpose of your letter is to go above and beyond a simple verbal apology. Then, summarize your reason for being late, even if you’ve already talked it out with your boss in person. Don’t forget to note the date and time to provide context for the situation.

I had an unexpected crisis at home that demanded my attention. I understand that my absence came at an inopportune moment for the company, and I would like to say once again how sorry I am.\" Keep the body of your letter short and sweet. Ideally, it should consist of only a few lines—your opening, a brief explanation, and a final acknowledgement of wrongdoing. Since it’s hard to take away a sense of tone from a written apology, you’ll want to include a line that conveys that you regret being late. Acknowledge how your mistake impacted your employer and coworkers, or what it cost the company if there were financial consequences.

Describe the exact steps you’ll take to follow through on your pledge, such as leaving earlier or scheduling your appointments more prudently. This will show that you’re focused on actionable solutions, not just empty excuses.

Thank your boss for their patience and understanding, and for taking the time to read your letter. Ending things on a gracious note will help soothe any lingering feelings of resentment and set a positive tone for future interactions.  Your final line doesn’t have to be anything too extravagant: \"I appreciate how gracious you’ve been throughout this whole ordeal, and I’m eager for another chance to prove my loyalty to the company.\" If nothing else, include a short gesture of thanks like, “Thank you for being understanding of these difficulties and my plans to correct them.”\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Send an apology letter if you happen to be exceptionally late.

Standing too close will make it difficult to work, and could make the other person uncomfortable. Extend your thumbs while pulling your fingers together and curling them slightly. Keep the top joint of each of your fingers straight—most of the bend should be in your third knuckles, where your fingers meet your palms.

Maintaining the “C” shape, turn your hands over so that your fingers point downwards. Slide your hands all the way down so that the webbing of your thumbs rests over the tops of their shoulders.

About an hour before guests are set to arrive, turn on the barbecue and preheat it for your food. This will make sure the grill is nice and hot and ready to go as soon as your guests arrive. When the grill is hot, put on long-cooking side dishes like baked potatoes and corn on the cob. Side dishes like corn and potatoes should go on the grill 30 to 60 minutes before you plan to eat. As soon as your first guests get there and lunch or dinnertime arrives, move your corn and potatoes off the grill and start cooking the main dish. To keep the sides warm while everything else cooks, wrap them in foil. Once the food is ready, put the side dishes, appetizers, and main food on the table so that guests can serve themselves and dress their food.

Your face, your voice, you is gonna be in the limelight at least until the election is over. People are going to be watching you and analyzing your every move. If you can convince them with your winning smile, calm demeanor, and persuasiveness that you're qualified for the job, it'll be smooth sailing. The most obvious examples are Barack Obama and JFK. When Barack steps up to the podium, his charisma just oozes out of him. His public speaking skills got him to where he is today. And then there's the famous JFK/Nixon debate, where JFK was so calm, cool, and collected that he made the nervous, twitchy Nixon look like a joke. So brush up! So while JFK schooled Nixon because of his charisma, it didn't hurt that he was 100x better looking and more put together. If you're gonna be in the public eye, you gotta look the part. That means ties, suits, and that wonderful pair of I'm-just-like-you khakis. And the shoes! Don't forget the shoes. You'll generally need two looks: the nice, fancy suit for your more formal functions and then the rolled-up Oxford and khakis when you're talking in the town hall. This goes for men and women, though a women's suit could either be a skirt or pants. If you expect people to vote for you, you gotta have your views and your views down pat. None of this wishy-washy flip-flopping -- or you'll be called on it faster than you can say \"John Edwards.\" Hopefully you figured these out pre-campaign (though in the realm of politics, changes of heart aren't exactly uncommon). You'll probably be encouraged to align your views with the majority. There is no book that says you have to do this. Your team may want you to, but you don't have to do a damn thing. It can get you votes, but what's gonna happen when bill-passing time rolls around? Hope the Catholic guilt doesn't get to you? Once you're a politician, you're basically signing off on your privacy. You're the closest thing to a movie star there is. Your image will be plastered everywhere from buses to the Daily Show. And it won't always be nice. So while it's gonna be hard handling the constant photo ops and always faking a smile, it's gonna be harder handling the criticism. Can you take it? The association between politicians and scandals is so ridiculous it's almost funny. If you're running for office, expect to have to face that everything from your dishonorable discharge in the military to that appealed DUI charge to a speeding ticket from 27 years ago. If it's the slightest bit juicy, it could come back to haunt you. This is not a career for the faint of heart. It's gonna involve late nights, name calling, begging, brown-nosing, and lots and lots of putting up with the trivial. There will be times when you'll feel on top of the world and there will be times when you'll feel like it's on top of you. You gotta have a thick skin and an impermeable sense of confidence.

The catalytic converter is a metal box near the front of the exhaust pipe that filters out harmful gases, such as nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide.

The oxygen sensors are electronic ports that plug into the exhaust system before and after the catalytic converters to check if your engine is burning oxygen efficiently.

The tailpipe is the small section of tubing that connects to the back of the muffler and allows the fumes to escape into the air. Exhaust fumes can get extremely hot while you’re driving, which can cause the pipes to heat up and cause burns.

He'll want to hang out with you as much as he can and will sometimes even cancel his other plans to be able to do so. If your guy friend suddenly seems to be contacting you to see what you're up to and find out whether you're busy every day, you may be dealing with a lovesick guy pal. Guys with big crushes on their lady friends will sometimes very subtly allude to their feelings in conversation. They do this in a number of ways. Some try to steer the conversation toward romantic topics, asking questions about who their female friend likes and whether she's looking for someone. Others will want to talk about the practice of dating itself, for instance, joking about how ridiculous most couples seem to be. Keep track of the types of conversations you have with your guy friend - if they mostly seem to be about romance or dating, even if he makes no indication that he's interested in dating you specifically, this may be his way of signalling his interest. There's an obvious exception to this rule. If your guy friend involves you in his love life by asking you for advice with other girls, it's usually a sign that he thinks of you as a non-romantic friend. Some guys are less shy than others. Especially confident guys may even enjoy openly flirting with you. If your guy friend has developed a habit of playfully teasing you, making silly innuendos, or seems to enjoy scandalizing you, this shows that, at the very least, he's thought about you as more than a friend. Realize that a guy's intentions can be somewhat vague when he flirts. Many guys have a habit of flirting, then playing their flirtation off as a joke if their advances aren't immediately reciprocated. Still others flat out use flirtation and innuendo as a form of goofing off. Persistent, repeated flirtation, however, is almost always a sign of something more. Guys who wish they were dating their gal friend sometimes recreate the atmosphere of a date when they're hanging out with her. Keep an eye out for this - when you meet your guy friend for a friendly meal, does he seem a little more \"formal\" than usual? For instance, if he's normally vulgar and loud-mouthed, does he become quieter and more reserved? Does he develop good manners out of nowhere? Does he insist on paying for you? If so, your guy friend may be taking you on a \"fake date\" in an attempt to make the real thing a possibility. Also, pay attention to where he takes you and how he dresses. If he takes you to fancier, \"nicer\" places than you'd normally go to while hanging out and he \"cleans up\" his appearance, you'll know you're on a fake date. This is one of the most important things to look for when trying to figure out whether a guy friend is into you, but it's something that's often overlooked. If you think your guy friend is being especially affectionate with you, before jumping to conclusions, pay attention to the way he interacts with other girls. If he acts the same way around other girls that he does around you, you may be dealing with natural flirt or extrovert, rather than a secret admirer. Listen when your guy friend talks to you about other girls. As noted above, if he openly asks you for advice on how to attract and win over other girls, he probably doesn't see you as anything more than a friend. However, if he seems unsatisfied with other girls, complaining about how he just can't seem to find the right person, this may be his way of hinting that he's interested in you.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "See whether he makes hanging out a special priority.

For men, having long hair is sometimes not acceptable in the corporate world, and as a hippie you should embrace the counter culture.  Dreadlocks are also another hair option for hippies. Hippies originally grew their hair long in protest against the Vietnam War and as a symbol of rebellion against the cultural norms of the 40’s and the 50’s Certain hair products, like aerosol cans, are bad for the environment, which doesn’t align with the hippie lifestyle. Being natural is essential to being a hippie, and certain cosmetics or personal care items like moisturizers or shampoos contain harmful chemicals, so make sure to read the labels before purchasing your products.  Some hair products are animal tested which also goes against hippie ideals.

You can buy more clothes than you normally would, since clothes at second hand stores are usually significantly discounted. Hemp based clothing is a common favorite for many hippies.

Avoid using cassava flour in recipes that require your food to rise like cakes. Food created with cassava flour will typically be a bit denser than if you used an all-purpose flour or other flour that contains gluten. Cassava flour is great for recipes like tortillas, pita bread, cookies, and brownies. While a measuring cup typically works in many cooking scenarios, cassava flour is denser than traditional wheat flour. For this reason, you'll want to measure your flour before you use it in a recipe using a digital scale. If you don't have a scale, the most accurate way to measure your flower is by fluffing it up and then scooping it using a measuring a spoon. This will prevent it from packing down. Once you're done measuring, level it off with a butter knife or other straight utensil. In many situations, cassava flour will work with a 1:1 ratio where you would usually use wheat flour. The only exception is when you are dealing with recipes that must rise or use yeast, as the flour is known to be denser and has issues rising. Cassava flour does not have the same nutritional value as wheat, so if you do decide to use it, make sure you are supplementing your diet with other foods that contain vitamins and nutrients. To become acclimated with how to properly use cassava flour, you should begin working it into the recipes that you are already used to making. Take note on how using the cassava flour changes the consistency and taste of your food. Determine if you like using the flour before incorporating it into more complex recipes.  Once you feel comfortable using cassava flour, start to experiment with other recipes. Cassava flour will impart a subtle earthy, and nutty flavor to whatever you're cooking. Take this into consideration when creating dishes. Look for products that say 100 percent Yuca (cassava) on the label. Avoid products that use artificial ingredients or fillers because these brands of flour aren't as healthy as pure cassava flour. Pure cassava flour will have one ingredient: Yuca.  Sometimes cassava flour will be called manioc flour.  A popular cassava flour is Otto's Naturals. If you are making a recipe that calls for yeast, you can use Xanthan Gum as a replacement. Xanthan Gum helps bind the cassava flour together. If you're not vegan, adding an extra egg to a recipe may also help bind foods that call for yeast. For most recipes, add 1/2 tsp (2.46 ml) xanthan gum for each cup of flour that you're using. While tapioca and cassava flour and made from the same root, they differ in use significantly. Tapioca flour is traditionally used as a thickening agent and works well in things like pudding or sauces while cassava flour can be used as a replacement for all purpose or gluten free flours. Do not get the two confused when buying your cassava flour. Tapioca is the extracted starch of the cassava root, while cassava flour is made by grinding and peeling the whole root.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Avoid cooking things that have to rise.

If this doesn’t happen—or if the symptoms worsen—make an appointment to see your doctor. Describe your symptoms to the doctor and clarify when the infection began. In some cases, your general practitioner may refer you to a dermatologist. If your belly-button infection is caused by bacteria, your doctor should write you a prescription for an antibiotic cream. These creams typically need to be applied to the affected area 2 or 3 times a day over a period of about a week. The infection—and any associated pain—should fade as you use the cream.  Ask your doctor how often you should apply the cream or ointment and how much to apply per treatment. Use gloves while applying the ointment, and always wash your hands with soap and warm water after touching the area or applying medications. This will help prevent the infection from spreading. In the case of a fungal navel infection, your doctor will prescribe an antifungal cream or ointment for you to use. Apply the cream as directed by rubbing it onto the red, flaky skin around your navel.  In the case of a mild belly-button infection, the doctor may recommend that you use an over-the-counter antifungal ointment or cream. Use gloves to apply the ointment and always wash your hands with warm, soapy water when you’re done. As basic as it may seem, a shower is the best way to clean your navel and keep bacteria and fungi out. Use a gentle soap, a soft washcloth, and warm water to clean your abdomen and navel.  Once you step out from the shower, don’t put any lotion onto your belly button (even if you apply lotion to the rest of your body). The lotion will make your belly button damp and will encourage bacteria to grow. To prevent the spread of infection, don’t share your towels or washcloths with anyone else, even your spouse or partner. Clean the shower or bath after you use it with a solution of 1⁄2  c (120 mL) of bleach per 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water. If your belly button is an “innie,” clean it with salt water to prevent another infection from occurring. Mix a spoonful of table salt in 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water. Then, dip 1 finger into the solution. Use your finger to massage the saltwater into the recesses of your belly button. Do this 1 time per day until your infection has cleared up. This should clean out any lingering bacteria and fungi. If you’d rather not use your finger to clean your navel, try using a clean, damp washcloth instead. Some navel infections are contagious and can spread to other people or other parts of your own body. Fungal infections can be especially easy to spread. Try to resist touching or scratching your navel while it is infected, and always wash your hands after touching it or applying lotion. Change and wash your clothing and bedsheets regularly.

Brush your teeth as you normally would, spit out the baking soda, and rinse your mouth with water. Make a paste of baking soda and water. Put some baking soda in a small container that you can close (to store the paste). Slowly stir water a few drops at a time into the baking soda until a smooth paste forms. Apply to your toothbrush, then brush and rinse your teeth as normal. Baking soda might irritate the tissues of your mouth. If you notice any inflammation or soreness, use this treatment less frequently. Baking soda combined with hydrogen peroxide makes a very effective teeth whitener. This treatment, however, should not be used frequently. Hydrogen peroxide can irritate the tissues of your mouth, and prolonged use may cause serious problems. To make this whitener:  Pour a teaspoon of baking soda into a bowl or small dish. Stir five to seven drops of hydrogen peroxide into the baking soda until a smooth paste forms. You can also add a drop of peppermint extract to improve the flavor of the mixture.  Apply to your toothbrush, then brush and rinse your teeth as normal. Be sure to spit out all of the peroxide—do not swallow it. Rinse your mouth well afterwards. Since the citric acid found in lemon juice is a natural bleaching agent, it can make a great whitening agent. You can make a paste by combining the two ingredients, and use it infrequently as a whitener.  Pour a teaspoon of baking soda into a bowl or small dish. Stir lemon juice a few drops at a time into the baking soda until a smooth paste is formed. Apply the paste to your teeth (using a finger is fine) and let it sit for two to three minutes. Rinse your teeth with water afterwards. Use this treatment no more than once a week, as citric acid can also damage the enamel of your teeth, and irritate the tissues of your mouth.

Call your guinea pig’s name and make sure she can see the treat on the other side of the hoop. Say the command: “Through the hoop”.

Holding on to resentment and bitterness will only poison your relationship in the future. Make a conscious decision to forgive your spouse and move forward.  It may be difficult to forgive your spouse all at once, especially if the betrayal happened recently. Instead, work towards a goal of forgiveness as you rebuild your relationship. Try saying something like \"I forgive you,\" or \"I am working on forgiveness\" out loud to yourself, your spouse, and to other people. Even if you don't feel ready to forgive just yet, saying your intentions out loud may help you to move towards feeling ready to forgive. Counseling can be an invaluable tool in rebuilding your relationship with your spouse. A counselor will help you figure out why the infidelity happened. They can also help you find ways to work through your emotions and teach you to communicate better with each other. Counseling can also help you and your spouse decide whether continuing the relationship is the right choice for you. Many people who have affairs do so because their needs are not being met at home. If this contributed to your spouse cheating, it's important to address that issue and take steps to fix it, if possible.  Lack of emotional intimacy and sexual fulfillment are among the most common reasons people stray. Taking responsibility for relationship problems doesn't mean excusing your spouse's infidelity. Designate regular times to check in with your spouse. Don't just talk about their affair – discuss your current feelings, what each of you needs from the other, and your goals for the relationship as you move forward. Talk about things that are not related to your relationships as well, such as your passions, goals, and dreams. This can help to restore some of the excitement in your relationship.  Re-opening channels of communication with your spouse helps to restore your relationship after living with the secrecy and lies of infidelity. If you find that you spend too much time discussing the affair itself, try setting aside 15 minutes a day to talk about it. Stick to other topics the rest of the time. After your trust has been compromised with an affair, it can be difficult to reconnect with your spouse on a physical level. However, if you choose to rebuild your marriage, this is a step you must take to fully recover and move on.  You can restore intimacy in your marriage by making an effort to communicate your deepest desires with your spouse—your inner thoughts and feelings. In addition, dating each other again may also help. Go on a romantic trip with your spouse. Return to your earlier days when you lovingly traded massages, cuddled on the couch most evenings, and discussed your days during dinner rather than eating in silence. Marriage counseling can also be helpful in allowing you and your spouse to cross the bridge back to sexual intimacy. This may take time as you may have built up walls after the infidelity, and it may be the last thing that you work on. Try to focus one rebuilding your relationship and this should follow in time.  It's important for you to both be honest with yourselves and fully grieve the betrayal to become physical partners again.  You can also make an effort to be physically affectionate with each other until you are ready to have an intimate relationship again. Simple things like holding hands, kissing each other goodbye, and giving each other hugs may help to improve your emotional and physical intimacy. Don't call your spouse constantly to check up on where they are or insist that they spend all their free time with you. While this behavior is understandable, it's likely to make your spouse feel smothered, which could drive a wedge between you. It is reasonable to ask for some accountability from your spouse after a betrayal. Just be careful not to cross the line into unhealthily jealous or controlling behavior. Doing new things can help you move past the affair together. Find things to do that will bring you closer and help you make new memories. Consider taking a weekend trip together, picking up a new hobby as a couple, or just making an effort to spend more time running errands and doing chores together.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Commit to forgiving your spouse.

This raises big legal and ethical problems. Before acting, seriously ask yourself if you want to do it. Is it worth the risk?  The situation is important. In England, for instance, a man rescued his elderly neighbor from a robbery by listening through the wall with a glass. In his situation, spying was definitely justified. Things are rarely so clear cut, however. You should probably not act if you have any doubts about the situation. If you decide to go ahead, make sure that you know the possible consequences of your actions. Eavesdropping means to overhear, record, magnify, or transmit any part of a private conversation without the consent of at least one person involved. Be aware that states have laws against eavesdropping. By spying you may well be breaking the law; you might even be violating the law by possessing a device for spying.  Your state may have a “one party consent” or “two party consent” law. One party consent means that it is illegal to eavesdrop unless you have the consent of at least one of the people engaged in a private conversation. In two party consent you must have permission from both parties to listen, record, or amplify their communication.  Take the state of Michigan. Michigan has a two party consent law – you must have permission from all parties in order to “overhear, record, amplify, or transmit any part of a private discourse.” This applies even in your own home. Eavesdropping there is also a felony. What happens if you eavesdrop and someone finds out? What could happen to you? This is a good question and you should consider all of the possible outcomes, which in many cases are severe.  In Michigan, the penalties for illegal eavesdropping are up to 2 years in prison, up to $2,000 in fines, or both. In California, eavesdropping is either a misdemeanor or felony. As a misdemeanor you face up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine; as a felony, you could spend up to three years in prison and a $2,500 fine.  Of course, a criminal penalty is not the only bad outcome. You also open yourself to a civil lawsuit for violating someone’s privacy, which could be costly and run into the thousands of dollars.

This will give them information they can use to advise changes, including specific additions you need to make to improve your diet. Your dietitian will be able to recommend specific additions to your diet, as well as ways of eating foods you like in a healthier way. One important topic to discuss with a dietitian is any eating preferences you have.  For instance, if you don’t eat meat, other forms of protein become especially important. Your dietitian will help you identify high quality non-meat proteins.  When selecting meat substitutes such as soy-based foods, be sure to choose options that are not too high in potassium, sodium, or phosphorus. While specific nutritional drinks for those undergoing dialysis can be helpful, only rely on these as a significant component of your diet under the guidance of a dietitian. Meanwhile, protein bars can be helpful meal replacements, but should not make up the majority of your diet. If you are on dialysis and selecting protein bars, choose those that have more than 15 grams of protein but less than 150 mg phosphorus and under 200 mg of both potassium and sodium. Depending on your overall health and nutrition, you may need to take nutritional supplements. The need to do so, as well as the type of supplement you should take, will vary depending on your diet and health.  As such, follow the guidance of your dietitian in particular. Simply ask something like, “Is there any specific nutritional supplement I should be taking considering my current nutritional levels?” Many of the questions your dietitian will ask you are meant to help them identify potential barriers that may be preventing you from getting adequate nutrition. More to the point, your dietitian will recommend different courses of action based on the specific reasons you may not be getting enough protein. Maintaining a healthy diet requires a bit of planning, especially if you are receiving dialysis treatment or have other health complications.  Even a very simple food plan can help you ensure you’re eating enough of what you need.  Aside from specific hints about what and how to eat, ask for advice regarding how to maintain healthier dietary behavior. At a minimum, develop and maintain a food plan to help make sure you eat protein with every meal. With the guidance of a dietitian, you may need to increase your caloric intake to help your body use the extra protein you’re eating. Your dietitian might even recommend using more butter while cooking, or putting more dressing on your salads. Many dairy products, including milk, contain too much potassium and phosphorus for those on dialysis who have low albumin.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Unlike a void marriage, a voidable marriage requires court intervention to dissolve. In New York, there are only five circumstances rendering a marriage voidable. The age of consent in New York with respect to marriage is 18.  If one spouse or both spouses was below the age of 18 at the time of the marriage, and were married without parental consent, then that can render a marriage voidable. If there is some reason that at least one spouse lacked the capacity to understand the \"nature, effect, and consequences of the marriage,\" then the marriage is voidable. Of course, there are a variety of reasons a person might permanently or temporarily lack capacity, but one of the most common situations that fits into this category is a marriage where one or both spouses are mentally handicapped. If at least one spouse is permanently physically unable to have sexual intercourse, but the other was unaware when the marriage began, that constitutes grounds for an annulment under New York law. If one or both spouses suffers from an incurable mental illness for five or more years, the marriage is rendered voidable. The action can be brought by either spouse or on behalf of either spouse.  If you are inclined to use this as grounds for an annulment, proceed with caution, because the court can award the sane spouse to financially support the mentally ill spouse. If consent was obtained through force, illegitimate pressure, or fraud, that will make the consent voidable.  Examples of fraudulent marriages would include misrepresenting a pregnancy, misrepresenting a willingness to have children, or marrying to obtain legal immigration status. In contrast to a void marriage, which is always invalid, in voidable marriages, spouses can waive by consent what would normally be grounds for an annulment. The different grounds for an annulment have different waivers.  If you seek an annulment because one of the spouses was too young to give consent, understand that if both spouses continue to live together after they turn 18, that constitutes a waiver.   If you plan to seek an annulment because of an inability to consummate the marriage, be aware that you need to initiate your case within the first five years of marriage. You will also need to show that you were unaware of this inability when the marriage started.   If you plan to seek an annulment on the basis of fraud, force, or duress, then you must bring the action within two years of your discovery of the fraud and within three years of the commission of the fraud. Furthermore, if you continue to live with your spouse after you discover the fraud, that will constitute a waiver. If the marriage was obtained by fraud, force, or duress, only the innocent party to the marriage can file for an annulment. If the issue was an inability to consent due to age, then only the underage party or their relatives can bring the action for annulment. If the issue is a lack of mental capacity, then either spouse can seek the annulment, in addition to the relative of the spouse who lacked capacity. If the issue was an inability to consummate, then either party may seek the annulment, although the incapable spouse will have to meet certain requirements in order to seek the annulment.  New York does not provide forms for procuring an annulment, and even the simplest annulment requires a trial where evidence is presented to prove the grounds for annulment. The type of proof necessary is dependent upon the grounds for obtaining the annulment, and in some cases, is extensive. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you use the services of an attorney if you wish to pursue an annulment. If you choose to initiate an action for annulment without the services of an attorney, you will first need to find a process server to serve your souse with a copy of the petition. The court requires that a third party to the action serve the documents. You can not serve them yourself. A proof of service is a document that notifies the court that your spouse has been given a copy of the annulment documents by a third person. The proof of service must be completed by the person who gives your spouse the annulment petition. The completed proof of service must be returned to the court within 120 days after you file your annulment. Your spouse has 20 days after the day he is served to file an answer with the court. After your spouse files his response, you will be served with a copy in the same way that you had your spouse served with your documents. The hearing will usually be 4 weeks or more after you file your petition for the annulment.  Research any area of annulment law specific to your marriage. Take the time to research and gather the documents related to your situation prior to the court hearing. This will make you more prepared for your court hearing. Think about who you will call as witnesses. The court may require more than just your testimony and that of your spouse, depending on the circumstances of your annulment. The court hearing may not be the only hearing necessary in your matter. If your annulment is simple, there are no children involved, and you and your spouse present all the necessary evidence to prove your annulment, then there may be no need for another hearing. However, the judge may need you or your spouse to supply him with additional information regarding the annulment. If so, he will tell you what he needs and give you another court date.  Complete any financial documents that are required for the annulment to be finalized. The court may require that you complete financial documents, especially if you and your spouse have children together. Follow all the additional instructions of the judge and bring all requested documentation to each court hearing.

You can also try having your toddler help you prepare the bath by asking them to pick out the bubble bath and helping them pour it into the tub while it’s filling. It may be that taking a bath in a big bathtub comes with too many new, unknown factors. To help the toddler adjust, place them in the tub without any water in it.

Dampen a sponge with some water (and soap, if desired) and sponge the toddler to clean off any dirt.  If you used soap, make sure you rinse the sponge out and remove all of the soap from their skin. If the weather is nice out, you can turn the sponge bath into an outdoor activity. See if the toddler is comfortable with showers if they don’t want to take a bath.

Well, the occasion is now -- bring them out and take pleasure in how much they add to the romantic atmosphere. Flowers, rose petals, and unscented candles will do the trick - you have many options and will just have to be creative. Remember that candles are essential for a romantic dinner, so light several candles and place them on or near the table. Flowers, such as elegant roses, are almost as important.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "A breach of contract occurs when one party fails to uphold his side of the contract without an adequate legal excuse. A breach of contract can be indicated by a failure to perform or by words or actions that indicate future nonperformance. If you are involved in a contract that involves materials (such as the sale of an item), you should be entitled to a full recovery of materials if the other party does not fulfill his end of the contract. For example, if you sell a boat to your neighbor and give him an owner-financed payment plan but he stops making payments, you are entitled to a full recovery of the boat, regardless of the amount your neighbor has paid towards the full amount. If you are the non-breach party in a contract, you can seek to mitigate (lessen) the damages caused by the other party’s breach of contract by seeking replacement goods or services (known as “cover.”)  If the cover costs you the same or less money than your original contract, you may not be entitled to damages.  However, if your cover costs you more, you can ask the contract-breaching party to pay the damages (the difference between the original cost and the cover.)  Finding cover as soon as possible to the breach of contract can help you show the court that you’ve done your best to avoid consequential damages, or further expenses due to your own failure to act.  For example, you may have a contract with a wedding photographer.  If your photographer backs out of the contract the week before your wedding, you may need to scramble and find a new photographer at the last minute.  If the last-minute photographer costs the same as your original photographer, there are no damages.  If the last-minute photographer charges you an additional $500 for the lack of notice, you can ask that the original photographer pay the $500 fee. If you cannot uphold your end of a contract, you can refuse to fulfill the obligations that are laid out in the contract. Refusing to perform your contractual obligations will constitute a breach of contract and may expose you to a breach of contract lawsuit. Before choosing this option, you should consult with an attorney to ensure that you completely understand all consequences of deciding to breach a contract. If the other party has breached a contract, you can file a lawsuit for damages incurred due to the breach.  Be sure that you have a copy of the contract, can specifically identify how and when the breach occurred, and document any financial or other damages that you accumulated as a result of the breach.  You can hire a lawyer to file the lawsuit for you, or you can do it yourself at your local courthouse. File the lawsuit as soon as possible after the breach.  States have varying statutes of limitations for how long after a breach a lawsuit can be filed, but waiting too long can prevent you from being able to take legal action against the breaching party. After a contract has been breached, the parties involved may want to consider using Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as a tool to settle a contract dispute. With ADR, anyone involved in the contract often share the cost of hiring a neutral mediator. This person will assist all of you to work out a mutually agreeable outcome. The ADR process includes an evaluation by a neutral third-party who isn’t a lawyer. It also includes a negotiation and mediation.  Arbitration is another form of ADR. It allows you to take care of the problem without going to court. Arbitration is a good idea in complex cases or when damages are difficult to calculate.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Identify a breach of contract.

Instead, address the issue when you are both feeling calm and rational.

Having an open conversation about what each partner expects is key to guiding acceptable behaviors. Be clear about your needs — your boyfriend may have no idea his friendship or flirtation with this other girl upsets you.  Work on defining these expectations with your boyfriend. You might say something like, \"I don't want you to give up your friendships with other girls, but I would appreciate it if your focus is on me when we spend time together, and not on texting her.\" Don't set boundaries that are vague or manipulative. Something like, \"I want to spend more time with you\" isn't specific enough. Try saying, “I want to spend more time together just the two of us. Could we designate a date night?” Let your boyfriend know what is and is not acceptable to you. If you are not comfortable with him giving another girl a back massage, let him know that feels disrespectful to your relationship.

Start at the base of the cylinder or pad, grasp a clump of hair, and gently pry up and away. It’s important to take your time as hair strands break easily and will become difficult to remove. When it comes to hairbrush cleansing tools, the miniature hairbrush rake tops the list. While this tool is similar to a comb, it is far more effective. Cleaning rakes vary in size, as well as in single or dual sides. For bristled brushes or if you have multiple styles and sizes of brushes, a dual sided rake is more versatile. Hold the bristled hairbrush over the sink, a trash can, or take it outdoors. Brush the nylon brush through the bristles of your hairbrush. This will remove hair buildup, as well as dislodge skin and dandruff flakes. Continue brushing until the nylon brush rakes cleanly through the brush bristles.  Wash the nylon brush to remove debris and allow it to dry completely before reusing it for this purpose. Teasing combs are dual sided with bristles and a hair sectioning point called a rat tail. Beginning at the base of your bristled brush, slide the rat tail under the collected hair and gently pull away from the brush. Repeat this on all sides of the cylinder or across the entire face of the pad. Once you have loosened and lifted the hair from the shaft, simply use your fingers to roll the hair up and off.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "One of a nurse's main jobs is to take direct care of patients.  You’ll likely see these people at their worst.  Nurses need to understand that their patients are human beings that are probably stressed, scared, depressed, upset, in pain, and confused.  This understanding requires the ability to be compassionate and empathetic.  Being able to put yourself in your patient’s shoes will help you understand what she's going through, and what she needs from you.  Often times, because a patient sees nurses most often, those nurses get the brunt of any anger the patient is feeling.  Being compassionate and empathetic means you do not take this anger personally.  Patients are likely sick or injured and not having a very good day!  Understanding that some patients may need to release their anger in order to reduce their stress or fear is what being compassionate is all about. In addition to patients, nurses often deal with the family and friends of their patients.  Being compassionate and empathetic means being able to show those family members and friends that you truly do care about your patient and are doing your absolute best to help her.  The following six steps can help you learn to be a more compassionate person: Step 1: Listen without judgement or formulating an immediate response. Try to understand the person's feelings, needs, and wants so that you can formulate a plan to best help her. Step 2: Reply back to the speaker based on her emotions and not her words.  For example, mean and angry words are likely a sign of someone who is scared or fearful. Step 3: Make sure you have someone who is compassionate to you.  This means having your own support system at or outside of work.  If you have a million problems on your mind, it may be harder to care about the problems of others. Step 4: Think about the whole person, not just who she is at that very moment.  You’re going to see many people at their worst, but that’s not who they really are.  Remember that there is much more to your patients than just what you see. Step 5: Think about a time when you were in a similar situation.  You may have an actual memory of your own you can borrow from, or you may simply need to imagine yourself in that situation.  Think about all the emotions you went through (or would go through) and how you felt (or would feel) in that situation. Step 6: Be able to forgive yourself for failure.  In essence, have some compassion for yourself.  You’re not going to be perfect.  You’re going to make mistakes.  But you’re human, and that’s normal.  Don’t beat yourself up. Being a nurse means you’re going to see people at their very worst.  You’ll likely have to take care of patients who are about to die.  You may need to take care of patients in an extreme amount of pain.  You may need to take care of patients who have just been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness.  Constantly being around people who are suffering can take an emotional toll on you.  As a nurse you need to be able to control your emotions while you’re on the job, and not allow those emotions to cloud your judgement or slow your reaction time.  Being emotionally stable doesn’t mean keeping all your emotions bottled-up forever.  It means knowing when the time is right for letting those emotions out.  And allowing yourself that emotional release on a regular basis. Try exercise, time with friends, yoga, reading, and developing hobbies. Emotional stability also doesn’t mean developing an ice-cold personality where you do not allow yourself to care about anything.  You need to allow yourself to care about your patients in order to provide them with compassion and empathy. Having, or being able to have, emotional stability may mean you have to do certain things outside of work so you’re able to control your emotions at work.  One helpful way to develop stable emotions and have better control over your mood is to practice mindfulness. This means being in the moment without thinking about the past, the future, or anything judgmental. Being a responsible nurse means not cutting any corners.  Not allowing yourself to make an error, but if you do, making sure the proper people know about the error you made and making sure it’s corrected as soon as possible.  Being responsible also means using your best judgement when evaluating a patients' needs and making good decisions that are in the best interests of your patients. If you are a nurse that works in an emergency room or an operating room, or something similar, you also need to be responsible with your time.  You need to understand that things do not always go as planed, and emergencies do not happen on a schedule that matches your shifts.  A good nurse is prepared to work longer if necessary and understand that’s just part of the job. . In addition to being compassionate, empathetic, and sympathetic to your patients and their needs, you also need to be respectful and non-judgemental about the decisions your patient has made in life.  It is not up to you, as a nurse, to judge your patients.  It is up to you to help them and make sure they leave you care in the best possible condition — regardless of how they may have ended up in your care in the first place.  It also means not treating patients differently because of their backgrounds, ethnicity, or personality.  A homeless man who is being treated for a drug overdose deserves just as much respect from you as a pregnant woman who has been hit by a car. Being respectful of your patients also means being truthful with them.  When communicating news — good or bad — you need to understand that the patient has the right to honesty.  Be straight-forward with your patients, but do it respectfully and with compassion. Keeping calm means maintaining your level-headedness.  It means having confidence in what you’re doing and the decisions you’re making.  Your confidence will grow not only throughout your education, but the longer you’re on the job.  And as such, your ability to remain calm will also improve.  As a nurse, you can’t panic when something unexpected happens, and you can’t freeze up because you aren’t sure what to do.  When you’re first learning your job and there’s an emergency situation, a more experienced nurses may push you out of the way and take over.  Do not take this personally or be upset.  Use this moment to observe exactly what’s going on, what the nurse is doing and how, and the specific details that are driving the nurse’s decisions.  Watching a more experienced nurse, especially in a crisis, can be one of your most useful learning experiences. Find out if there are trainings offered to help you work through specific scenarios such as sudden cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, or stroke. By attending these trainings, you can practice going through these steps in a less intense environment so that in the real situation, you will be able to work through it easier. As a nurse no two days will ever be the same.  While you may have some routine, it is likely that that routine will also change every now and again.  No two patients are going to behave the same, even when they’re getting the exact same treatment.  Nurses need to be adaptable and flexible.  Nurses need to understand that their work environment and job requirements will change on a daily basis.  Being flexible and adaptable, and just going with the flow, will not only help your day go smoother, it will help reduce the amount of stress you feel. Nurses, just like many professions, are constantly learning.  Whether they learn through a formal classroom environment, or simply by observing, doesn’t matter.  What matters is that you are constantly improving your knowledge and skills, and recognizing specific areas where you might need improvement.  It also means receiving feedback from your peers and supervisors critically, and working with your supervisor and others to correct any deficiencies you have with your skills.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Understand and have the ability to be compassionate.

It's best not to give puppies extra space because they're liable to do their business in one corner of the crate instead of asking to go outside.  Crates often range in size from 18\" x 12\" x 14\" for small breeds all the way up to 48\" x 30\" x 33\" for large or giant breeds. For maximum convenience, get a crate that's the right size for your full-grown dog and insert a temporary physical divider into it to create a smaller space for your puppy. Move the divider back as your puppy grows. Both crates and dividers are available at most pet stores. Before you train your puppy to sleep in their crate, it's important to familiarize them with it and establish it as a positive place. Introduce your young pet to their new crate by putting it in a social space, like your living room, with the door open. Drop treats and/or toys into the crate to encourage your dog to explore inside it. You want your puppy to think that going inside the crate is their idea, so don't force them in it. Let them explore it at their own pace while you praise them in a happy voice. The fastest way to get your dog used to their crate is to relocate their meals to inside of it. Feeding them in their crate helps establish it as a safe, happy place.  If your puppy is wary of going into the crate at first, start by feeding them just outside the crate. Then, put their dish right by the door so that they're eating with their head inside the crate. Keep moving the food bowl further and further back with each mealtime until their entire body is inside. Once your dog is comfortable feeding in the crate, close the door while they eat and let them out immediately afterwards. Then, gradually extend the time they are in the crate with the door closed after eating from a few minutes to a quarter of an hour. This will help them become comfortable with being confined in their crate. Playing crate games teaches your puppy to stay in their crate while associating staying in it with positive rewards. Start by leading your pet inside their crate and closing the door without latching it. Have a handful of treats in one hand and hold the door with the other.  Now, open the door with one hand while feeding your dog treats through the side of the crate with the other. If they stay in their crate, they get the treats. If they try to run out, quickly close the door before they can and start again. Once they have this routine down, it's a good thing to do each morning when you're letting them out of the crate since it rewards them for staying in the crate during the night and teaches them to wait for your command to leave the crate. Playing this crate game will give your dog positive associations with their crate. It will also teach your pup that they have choices. Their good behavior and decisions will result in a reward while their bad behavior and decisions will lead to restrictions. If you want your puppy to sleep well in their own bed, you need them to associate their crate with rewards and relaxation. Confining them to their crate as a disciplinary measure will only reinforce their fear and suspicion of it. Since young puppies cannot control their bladder yet, you should not leave the puppy in the crate for more than three or four hours at a time.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Get a crate of an appropriate size.

Check if your tree is suitable and able to thrive in your area’s climate.  Determine if your space can accommodate the full grown height and width of your tree. Ensure your space is protected from high winds and that it receives adequate sunlight. If frozen soil is an issue in your area, be sure to dig the hole for your tree early in the winter before the ground freezes over. Dig a hole about four to five times the size of your tree’s root ball in diameter and slightly shallower than the root ball in depth. Livings trees that spend more than 7-10 days indoors may lose hardiness and be unable to thrive once replanted. Just as you acclimated your tree to indoor temperatures, you must do the same when preparing to bring it back outdoors. Spend about a week slowly transitioning your tree from inside your home to outside using your garage or enclosed porch. During this period, keep your tree away from high winds, direct sunlight and warm areas. Only natural burlap or biodegradable containers are safe to be planted. Treated burlap, nylon or plastic containers must be removed. If after removing the covering your tree’s roots are bound tightly together, gently break up the massed roots on the outer layer of the root ball. Plant your tree slightly higher than the surrounding soil to help with drainage. If the area where you plan to replant your tree is still frozen, you will need to wait for it to thaw before replanting. Keep your tree in a sheltered spot outdoors until the soil is thawed. Level the soil to the top of the tree’s roots. Spread 2-3” of mulch over top of the area. During the replanting process, your tree will still need water. If your area is dry in the winter, you may need to continue watering your tree once it is replanted. Monitor the soil to determine if your tree needs additional moisture or not.

There are a few specific viruses such as the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and HIV that require specific goal directed therapy with antiviral drugs. Viral meningitis is spread person to person contact. A groups of viruses called enterovirus is the primary source and occur most typically in the late summer to early fall. Despite it being possible to be spread by person to person contact, outbreaks of viral meningitis are rare. There are three kinds of bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis, which is the most worrisome and lethal. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common form to strike infants, young children, and adults in the US. There is a vaccine for this bacteria, however, so it is curable. It is spread most commonly from a sinus or ear infection and should be suspected when a person with a prior sinus or ear infection develops symptoms of meningitis. Certain people are at higher risk, such as those who do not have spleens and those who are older. Vaccination for these individuals is protocol. Another bacteria that causes bacterial meningitis is Neisseria meningitidis. This is a highly contagious form that afflicts otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults. It is spread person to person and outbreaks occur in schools or dorms. It is particularly lethal, leading to multi-organ failure, brain damage, and death if not rapidly identified and started on intravenous antibiotics.  It also has the distinction of causing a “petechial” rash, meaning a rash that looks like lots of tiny bruises, and this is an important distinction to note. Vaccination is recommended for all adolescents 11 to 12 years of age, with a booster at age 16. If no prior vaccine was given and the patient is 16, only one vaccination is required. The third bacteria that causes bacterial meningitis is Haemophilus influenza. This used to be a very common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants and children. However, since a Hib vaccination protocol has been introduced, rates have dropped dramatically. With the combination of immigrants from other countries that don’t follow routine vaccination or even parents who do not believe in vaccination, not all are protected against this form. Obtaining an accurate vaccination history, preferably  from the actual medical record or yellow vaccine card, is critical when this, or any, form of meningitis is considered. It is recommended that the following groups with high risk of contracting meningitis have routine vaccinations:  All children ages 11-18 U.S. military recruits Anyone who has a damaged spleen or whose spleen has been removed College freshmen living in dormitories Microbiologists exposed to meningococcal bacteria Anyone who has terminal complement component deficiency (an immune system disorder) Anyone traveling to countries which have an outbreak of meningococcal disease Those who might have been exposed to meningitis during an outbreak\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Learn about viral meningitis.

It’s best to do this immediately after the sighting so everything is fresh in your head. When it’s fresh, it’s more likely to be accurate. You'll use this information to file a report to specific agencies. Here's what to start with:  Number of witnesses (to be valid, there needs to be at least 1 other person) Time Location (if you live next to an Air Force base or other similar area, your report may be discarded) Number of objects seen Do ‘’not’’ include your personal information in the body of the report. It will have to be removed later. The more details you have, the more convincing your story will be (or the easier it will be to determine if it’s something else). Think back to experience. These are the aspects you should cover:  Lights (How many were there? Were they flashing or solid?) Color (Did the color ever change?) Brightness (Compare it to another object, if possible) Motion (How fast did it go? Did it move up and down? Back and forth? Smoothly or erratically?) Behavior (Did the object move or land, emit lights, sounds, or other objects?) Interactions with space (Did it engage with other aircraft in the vicinity, produce electrical or magnetic effects, such as a car engine stopping?) Trail, haze, etc. (Was there an aura or haze around the object, any cloud or smoke trails from the object?) Think of holding up an object at arm’s length to block the view of the UFO. Would you need a dime? A cookie? A plate? Something in between? This may be about as close as you can get. Think of the other objects around to determine how far away it was. Was it well above the trees? Hills? Power lines? Satellite towers? This can help you assess it's apparent distance. There are a few common standards currently known – does your experience fall in line with any of these shapes?   Saucer: there are three varieties – domed (stereotypical), lenticular (pistachio-shaped), and lenticular with dome  Hat: there are three varieties – conical hat, double hat, and flat top straw hat  Sphere: a standard circular shape  Saturn: in the shape of the planet, as if the object has rings  Ellipsoidal: egg-shaped when hovering, football-shaped while flying  Cylindrical: this object looks like a giant cigar  Dirigible: shaped like a pointy bullet; generally followed by a luminous plume  Triangle/boomerang: wedge-shaped or v-shaped, like a boomerang The better the weather (fewer clouds, no rain, etc.) the more reliable your story will be and the harder it will be to argue you didn't see what you saw. However, that being said – don't be tempted to lie if it was bad; it's quite easy to find out what the weather actually was that day if need be. If it was cloudy or rainy, explain how that affected your vision. Did it obscure anything, even if just partly, from view? Did anything change as the clouds parted or as the rain lifted? Could anything you saw be due to visual distortion from clouds or other natural phenomena? One of the most effective ways to make your sighting convincing is to include pictures or video – good pictures or video, that is. Don’t bother fabricating something – UFO hoaxes have been around long enough that most can be debunked.  The best photos aren’t digital. In fact, negatives (on tangible film) are best to prove it hasn’t been tampered with. If it is digital, don’t even think about even so much as resizing it. If it’s been changed from its original form even in the minutest detail, it might get thrown out. The best videos have other objects in them for reference and are stationary, so you can see the UFO’s movement, instead of a video that’s panning along with them.

Include any specific knowledge you have from your background that aids the story (for example, if you’re a pilot or have flight/mechanical training).  It doesn't have to be fancy, but it should be typed up (you'll likely submit it online, so you can just copy and paste it over) and spell-checked.

You might also wish to purchase a seatbelt designed specifically for your dog, to keep it as safe as can be during any road trips.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Good class notes from your teacher’s lectures and class discussions can be great study tools for tests and exams. Look over your class notes and check if there are incomplete sentences or any confusing statements. Clarify anything you missed in class or are still confused about with your teacher so you can better prepare for the upcoming test. If you have an incomplete chemistry formula written down, for example, you should clarify the complete formula with your teacher or a peer. Focus on recent class notes, especially the notes made in your most recent class, as they will likely contain important information you can use to prepare for the test. One of the best ways to make your class notes more instructive is to use visual diagrams and representations, such as the scientific process of condensation. Drawing out scientific processes can help you to better visualize them and remember them later. Use a highlighter to go through your class notes and identify any key points that seem relevant to the test. Marking important concepts with a highlighter will allow you to easily scan your notes and digest complex information through the key details or points.  For example, you may have notes of the process of condensation from your chemistry class or notes on the digestive system from your biology class. These processes can be detailed and contain a lot of information that can be challenging to remember. Using a highlighter to identify key points can help you to focus on the most important details in the process without getting overwhelmed by information. In your notes on the process of condensation, for example, you may start with a definition of condensation: “The process of changing water vapor in the air into liquid water.” Rather than highlight the entire sentence, you may highlight the terms “water vapor” “air” and “liquid water”. This will help you remember the key terms of the definition so you can recall it easily when you take the test. Your teacher may provide a guide for the test that contains example questions or a list of key points that are going to be on the test. Make sure you have a copy of the study guide and use it when preparing for the test.  You should clarify the form of the test, such as multiple choice, short answer, or true/false. The form of the test will then help you better prepare for the test. If the test is multiple choice or true/false, you may want to focus on memorizing key definitions, examples, and concepts. If the test is short answer, you may want to practice writing out short answers that explain key definitions and concepts. An example study guide for a test on condensation, for example, may contain questions like, “What is the process of condensation?” “How is condensation different from evaporation?” “How can we demonstrate condensation in an experiment?” Though these questions may not be the exact ones used on the test, they will likely point to key concepts or points that you should study in preparation for the test. . Flashcards can be useful for studying difficult concepts, especially if you are trying to remember key definitions and terms. You may decide to use a color coded system to separate key definitions from key concepts and write them on different colored flashcards.  If you are creating flashcards for a test on the process of condensation, for example, you may write the definition of condensation on a green flashcard and the difference between condensation and evaporation on a yellow flashcard. You may then write the definition for evaporation on a green flashcard and the use of a pressure temperature graph on a yellow flashcard. Separating definitions from concepts can allow you to test yourself on different things using the flashcards, but still ensure they remain separate as you review them. The color coding can also help you distinguish between a definition and a concept. Recent studies have shown that studying information in chunks, also known as spaced repetition, can help you to better retain information and access it later during a test. Rather than try to memorize the entire condensation process or the complete digestive process in humans, you can break up the information into smaller sections or chunks and study each section over a period of time. Break up your study materials into chunks using a highlighter or a pen. You can also cover the information around the section with a piece of blank paper so you are only focusing on the one chunk, instead of the surrounding information. This will prevent you from getting distracted and allow you to stay focused on one section at a time. Once you have reviewed and organized your study materials, you should create a study schedule. A study schedule will allow you plan your study time in the most efficient manner possible and avoid procrastinating or wasting time. Try to plan your study schedule at least one to two weeks before the test. This will give you more than enough time to prepare and will ensure you stick to your study schedule.  The study schedule should include one to two studying methods and indicate how many hours a day you will be studying for the test. Try to plan out exactly how much time you will allot to each method and ensure you are able to cover all the information required for the test within the allot timeframe. Keep in mind most people can concentrate well for 45 minutes before losing interest or zoning out. Take breaks between study sessions if you plan to study for more than 45 minutes at a time. For example, on Monday night, you may do a twenty minutes session using the chunking method, followed by a review of key definitions using flashcards for twenty five minutes. On Tuesday night, you may do a review of the previous night’s studying and then move on to a new section in your notes. Once you complete a twenty minute session using the chunking method on a new section, you may do another round of review of key concepts with your flashcards for twenty five minutes. You may then continue this pattern until Friday, and do a big review day on the weekend, taking breaks between study sessions so you can digest the information in your study materials.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Read over your class notes.

Remember that miniature roses should be planted at least 6 inches (15 cm) deep, while full-sized plants and bushes may need 18 inches (46 cm) to get comfortably situated. Heap the loose soil around the edges of the container rather than throwing it out. You’ll need it to fill in the hole later. Remove the young rose from its nursery pot and transfer it to the growing container. Use your fingers to gently separate the roots so that they’re spread out evenly within the soil. Then, push the loose soil in around the plant and pat it down lightly to compress it.  The top of the soil should be about even with the bud onion (the bulbous, woody stalk at the base of the plant from which the stems will sprout), so that the roots are submerged by 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm).  Be sure to pack the soil firmly enough to anchor the rose, but not enough to smother or constrict it. Plant your rose at about the same level it was at in the pot or container. You will want a pot that is deep enough to fit your root ball and still leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the soil and the top. This helps prevent spilling when watering. If you’re cultivating a full-sized species, drive a gardening stake down into the soil just off to one side of the plant and bind it to the plant's lower canes using a looped rubber band or piece of twine. Once in place, it will act as a support structure for the rose to cling to as it grows.  Sink the stake as deep as possible to make sure it's secure. Ideally, it should reach all the way down to the bottom of the container. When raising an entire bush in a barrel, washtub, or grow bag, it’s a good idea to put down multiple stakes 10–12 inches (25–30 cm) apart.

Applying pressure will restrict the flow of blood and allow a scab to form. The water on the washcloth will also clean dirt from the cut. If the mole hasn't stopped bleeding after 30 seconds, continue applying pressure until the bleeding stops. If you’d rather not get blood on a washcloth, try using a paper towel or a clean rag. Once you’ve stopped the bleeding, lightly press an ice cube against your cut. This will constrict the small capillaries right beneath your skin and prevent the small wound from reopening. Depending on the size of the cut mole, you might only need to hold the ice cube in place for as few as 15 seconds. Try removing the ice cube after 15 seconds and see if the mole still bleeds. Since a small amount of bacteria may have gotten into the mole when it was cut, it’s a good idea to disinfect the wound before covering it. Wash the area with soap and water or wipe it with an alcohol prep pad. Then, pat it dry and apply a small dab of an antiseptic or antibiotic cream or ointment (like Neosporin) onto the scraped mole. This kind of cream comes in most first-aid kits or can be purchased at a local drug store or pharmacy. As an alternative to the antibiotic cream, splash a small amount of alcohol-free aftershave onto the cut. Or, if you don’t have aftershave, use a splash of witch hazel toner to disinfect the cut. You can purchase aftershave or a witch hazel toner at a pharmacy or department store. Once the mole has stopped bleeding, cover it with a Band-Aid. This will soak up any remaining blood and prevent dirt and dust from getting into the skin wound. If you’re concerned about the cut getting infected, cover the absorbent patch of the Band-Aid with a small amount of medical disinfectant like Neosporin.  If the mole is in a location where a Band-Aid would fall off (e.g., your knee), purchase a specialty Band-Aid designed to fit a joint like your elbow or knee. The scratched mole should heal completely within 2-3 days. If you happen to nick a mole when you’re away from a first-aid kit, you can cover the scratch with petroleum jelly or lip balm. Smear a small amount of the petroleum jelly or lip balm onto your cut mole after you’ve stopped the bleeding with a washcloth. This will form a barrier that keeps blood inside of the cut mole and keeps bacteria out. Gently wipe off the lip balm after about 30 minutes. If your mole is bleeding heavily enough that it soaks through a Band-Aid, cover it instead with a 2 in × 2 in (5.1 cm × 5.1 cm) patch of gauze.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Mindfulness meditation is one of the most popular styles of meditation for reducing anxiety. To practice it, you must simply focus all of your attention on the present moment, which helps retrain the brain not to fixate on the past or on the future.  It's natural for your thoughts to wander, so don't get discouraged. If thoughts or emotions come up, acknowledge them, but do not judge yourself for them. Then do your best to replace them with thoughts about the present. Keeping your eyes open will help you stay focused on the present.  Many people like to consciously focus on their breathing while meditating, which helps keep breaths deep, while also preventing other thoughts from taking over the mind. If you are having trouble staying focused on your breath, you can try counting your breaths or repeating the words \"inhale\" and \"exhale\" to yourself silently. Loving-kindness meditation is similar to mindfulness meditation in that you replace unwanted thoughts with other thoughts. Instead of focusing your thoughts on the present moment, however, you can focus them on anything that involves love and kindness.  Your thoughts should express love and kindness towards yourself, as well as towards others. You can practice mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation together, as they complement each other nicely. Guided meditation is sometimes called visualization. This meditation style involves thinking deeply about a place or situation that you find relaxing. When practicing this type of meditation, you should try to engage all of your senses by imagining the sights, smells, sounds, tastes, and feelings that you would experience if you were really there. Guided meditation can be done alone, but it is often done in a class under the instruction of a teacher. If you choose to practice transcendental meditation, you will repeat a mantra to yourself to help achieve relaxation. This mantra can be any word, phrase, or sound that you find comforting. The way you say the mantra is also important. You should be focusing deeply on every aspect of the mantra. Meditation does not always have to be done sitting down. In fact, there are a variety of practices that combine exercise and meditation. If you don't like sitting still, this may be the perfect option for you.  Tai chi, qi gong, and yoga are all practices that involve movement, as well as meditation. If you are interested in learning one of these practices, they are offered at many fitness clubs and community centers. You can also try watching an instructional video. If you want to add a less structured physical component to your meditation practice, you can also consider walking while you meditate.

While some people have a natural ear, others can learn to develop pitch recognition. However, about 1 in 20 people are “tone deaf” (a condition called amusia) and cannot learn this skill. Find a digital tuner, piano, or acoustic guitar. Digital tuners are ideal for this exercise because the tool tells you if you are too sharp or too flat. If you don’t have access to any of these tools or instruments, there are several vocal match websites and apps available for you to choose from. A target note is the musical note that you wish to match in pitch. You can choose any note within your vocal range—you could start by trying to match pitch with the lowest \"C\" in your vocal range. As you move through the exercise, continue to pick random notes that fall within your vocal range and attempt to match their pitch.  Play the target note on the digital tuner, piano, or guitar. Listen to the pitch carefully. Try to hear the note in your head. This ability to hear, or visualize, a note in your head is called auralizing. This skill is developed over time and through persistent practice. Sing the target note. If you are using a digital tuner, look at the screen to see if you have perfectly matched the pitch, if you are flat, or if you are sharp. If you are off key, slide your pitch up or down slightly until you perfectly match the pitch. This can be tricky and often takes a lot of practice. Once you have matched pitch, select a new target note and repeat the process. It may take you a while to find notes that are within your vocal range and you are comfortable singing. Don’t be afraid to experiment with notes in different octaves. Scales are musical exercises that go up and down in a predetermined pattern. Major scales are the most predictable and familiar. When you sing scales, you can focus on mastering a specific technique, such as vibrato, overcoming a certain problem, like pitchiness, or increasing your vocal range.  Play a major scale on a piano or acoustic guitar, find an online video of a major scale, or use an app to play one. The C Major scale is an excellent place to start. The C Major scale follows this pattern: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, C, B, A, G, F, E, D, C. Listen to each pitch and visualize the note in your head. Play the exercise and sing along. As you move up and down the scale, focus on matching and maintaining each pitch. After mastering one major scale, move on to another major scale. Repeat the process. Arpeggios, like scales, are musical exercises. Instead of moving up and down from pitch to pitch, arpeggios go up and down in intervals. Practicing arpeggios will not only improve your pitch, but they will also enhance your ability to jump from one pitch to another pitch as you sing.  Play a major arpeggio on a piano or acoustic guitar. Basic arpeggios follow this pattern: 1, 3 (Major Third), 5 (Perfect Fifth), 8, 5 (Perfect Fifth) , 3 (Major Third), 1. Start with the C Major arpeggio. It follows this pattern: C (1), E (3, Major Third), G (5, Perfect Fifth), C (8), G (5, Perfect Fifth),  E (3, Major Third), C (1). Listen to each pitch and interval. As you hear the notes, visualize the pitches and intervals in your head. Play the exercise and sing along. As you move up and down the arpeggio, strive to match and maintain each pitch. Pay particular attention to hitting each interval. After mastering the C Major Arpeggio, work on another Major Arpeggio.

Dwelling on what happened or how it made you feel will not make you feel better; it will make you feel worse. Find something else to focus on right away. For example, you can look for the good in the moment by writing down three things that you are grateful for. Or, you can distract yourself by doing something else that you enjoy. For example: If you feel like you've been stuck at home while your friends are out having fun, do something to spoil yourself. Take a bubble-bath with your favorite scented candles and a book. Take a long walk or a run while listening to music. Go into town and go shopping, or just browse the shops on your own. Whatever you do, make it all about you and making yourself happy. Rejection can be very upsetting and you might find yourself feeling worked up or stressed as a result. Research has shown that taking a few minutes to practice deep breathing can reduce stress and promote a feeling of calm.  To practice deep breathing, take in a slow deep breath as you count to five. Then, hold the breath as you count to five again. Then, slowly exhale as you count to five. Follow this exercise with two normal paced breaths and then repeat the slow deep breath. You might also try yoga, meditation, or tai chi to help yourself feel calm. Being left out can cause you to feel sad and get down on yourself. Using positive self-talk can help you to combat these negative feelings and feel better after being rejected. After being left out, take a few moments to look at yourself in the mirror and say something encouraging to yourself. You can either say something that you believe about yourself or something that you would like to believe about yourself. Some examples of positive affirmations include:  “I am a fun and interesting person.” “I am a good friend.” “People like me.” “People enjoy spending time with me.” Caring for yourself can make you feel loved rather than rejected. This can take many different forms because different people feel cared for by different means. Some examples include cooking yourself a nice meal, taking a long bubble bath, working on a project you love, or watching your favorite movie. You should also make sure that you are taking good care of your body. By taking good care of your body, you are sending your brain signals that you deserve to be taken care of. Make sure that you are devoting enough time to meeting your basic needs for exercise, food, and sleep.  Aim for 30 minutes of exercise per day. Eat a balanced diet of healthy whole foods like fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Get 8 hours of sleep per night.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Move past the situation. Breathe to calm yourself.

Hold the spoons in your right hand. Position your right hand between your left hand and leg. Remember that your left hand should be about 5 inches or so above your leg. You will create a clacking, rhythmic noise with your spoons by striking them down into your leg and up into your left hand. Lightly tap your spoons several times slowly until you feel comfortable with the grip. You can create different tones with your spoons by striking different parts against your left hand or leg. The two main striking points are the tip, which is the rounded end of the spoon opposite the end of the handle, and the cup of the spoon, which is the hollow part.  Striking the tip of your spoons up into your left hand or down into your leg will create a lighter, brighter sound in your spoons. Hitting the cup of your spoon up into your left hand or down into your leg will creates a stronger, more accented sound. When attempting to strike the tip of your spoons, you may find it easiest to hold your left hand at a slight angle, so that you can bring the tip of your spoon up into the meaty part of your hand where the thumb joins the palm. This posture will help prevent you from hitting too much of the cup of the spoon, creating a louder clacking. Cup strikes will be flatter against your leg and left hand. Strike one cup against your leg, and then bring it up into the meaty part of your hand, where the thumb joins your palm. Both strikes should be as flat as possible to create the strong, accented tone of a cup strike. At first, you’ll probably want to do this slowly. This will ensure you keep your spoons gripped correctly while coordinating the different strikes. Repeat the earlier exercise where you accented the second and fourth beats of your rhythm, only this time use a clap strike to accent and your tip strike on beats one and two.  As you become more comfortable, try different patterns. You might try only accenting the third beat, or the first and fourth beats.

Regular or full members will have unrestricted access to the country club's services and grounds, but this level of membership also carries the most expensive fees. House or social members have limited access to many of the grounds. Some parts of the club, like the restaurant and pool, might still be open without restriction, though. Nonresident members pay the least amount in fees, but the club only opens certain services to them. The amount of time you can use those services and grounds will also be restricted. Many posh and executive country clubs will only allow you to join on referral. In these instances, it is best to look for 1 or 2 sponsors before you fill out the application. In many cases, these referrals come from your friends or work associates. The sponsor and co-sponsor will usually need to submit a letter of recommendation in your favor. If you don’t know anyone who belongs to a country club, ask around at your work to see if someone is a member. Get to know that person and then, when you feel comfortable, ask them for a recommendation. In most cases, applications can be obtained by contacting the Membership Director of whichever country club you’re looking to join. This application will ask for basic contact information, a photo ID, and the names of your sponsors. The application will also ask about your family and hobbies. Additionally, many country clubs will require you to agree to a credit and background check.  These checks are done to verify that you will be able and likely to pay your membership. Some country clubs make the application available on their website. A poor credit rating will decrease your odds of acceptance. Once your application, background check, and credit check clear, you will be asked to schedule an interview. It takes about 2 weeks for the club to process your information and set up an in-person interview. You’ll speak with a few current members about a wide range of topics, such as your background and how you plan on using the club’s amenities. Once they’ve completed the interview, the membership committee members will speak with the Board of Directors and could potentially recommend you for admittance. This is why it’s incredibly important to give a good impression to the interviewers. During or after your interview, you might be invited to tour the grounds and test the facilities. Touring the grounds will give you an opportunity to meet the members. Both you and the voting members will get a better idea of whether you'll fit in with the others at the club.  If you already know one of the members, you might be able to tour the grounds before you have to submit the application or sit through an interview. Once the interview process is done, you’ll have to wait about 30 days for a response. If the voting board of the country club accepts you for membership, you'll get a call or letter with congratulations and an invoice. Initiation fees are a one-time payment that could range anywhere from $1,000 to $100,000 depending on which club you’re trying to join. If your application is rejected, you will need to start the process over with a different country club.  Some clubs may give you a reason for rejecting your application, but not all country clubs will do so. One reason a club might reject you is because it didn't get a great impression of you from the interview. Applying to the same club more than once is not recommended unless the circumstances you were rejected upon change. For example, the club could come under new management, in which case it would be okay to re-apply for admission.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Inquire about the different membership levels.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "You might have noticed going over potholes and bumps isn't as smooth as it used to be in your ride, which is probably a sign that your shocks are worn out and need replaced. A good easy way to test your shocks and make sure they're worn out enough to be replaced is to push down hard on the trunk or the hood directly above the wheel well. Good shocks should bounce up once and settle relatively quickly. If the body bounces any more than that after pushing, it's time for a new set. You also need to know if your vehicle uses stand-alone shocks that attach to the vehicle suspension or frame, or if it uses shock-absorber units which integrated into a suspension strut, such as the MacPherson or Chapman strut. Your car may even have a combination, using shocks in the front and struts in the back. Struts can be difficult to replace, so it's best to let a professional handle that job. If you're unsure what type of shock absorbers you need, speak to someone at your local auto parts store or an auto mechanic to be sure you buy the right shock absorbers or piston for your vehicle. You can get identical replacements of the shocks you have in your car currently, but taking the time to change out your shocks is also a good opportunity to perform any upgrades, if you're interested. Performance shocks are appropriate for heavy-use daily drive vehicles, especially trucks.   Coil shocks are manufactured with a coiled spring around the body of the shock, which supports the weight of the vehicle and controls the movement of the suspension. These are adjustable, which means you can alter the height of your truck for optimum performance.   Twin-tube shocks have a set of tubes, one inner and one out, that house the piston, along with a layer of shock fluid and air, which can have a tendency to create a foamy, frothy mixture that can affect performance, though some modern variations feature a nitrogen mixture that addresses the issue. These are common on off-road vehicles.   Monotube shocks feature a tube and two pistons, which work essentially like the twin-tube shocks work, with one piston separating the layer of nitrogen from the air. It runs cool and is a popular performance choice for trucks.   Reservoir shocks are filled with fluid, and either pressurized air or nitrogen. As the shock absorbs bounce, the fluid contacts the gas, causing resistance and dampening the spring action. Park your car on a level surface and loosen the lug nuts on both sides of the front or back end. Secure your vehicle with ramps and/or jack stands. Check your owner's manual for the correct jack positioning. When you've got the car up, remove the wheels and locate the shocks. Shocks will be affixed with a vertical bolt that has to be extracted from within the engine bay or the trunk, or may be positioned at the top by a horizontal bolt that has to be unfastened and knocked out of position. The most difficult part of the job is removing the old shocks, which can have a tendency to be really gunky with both age and road-grit, making the bushings and bolts somewhat difficult to remove. Check out the mountings to see if they're loose enough to get off, or if you're likely to crack the rubber around the bushing. It's ok if you do, since you're changing out the shock anyway, but it's usually easier to spray some WD-40 or PB Blaster in there and let it sit for a few minutes to try to loosen things up before you get to work.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Make sure you need new shocks.

For example, “With due respect, I am a 12th grade student in Mrs. Williams’ homeroom.” Or “I’m a part-time sophomore living in Fox Hall.” If you are a parent writing on behalf of a student, introduce yourself and your relationship. You might say, “I’m writing on behalf of my daughter, Molly Walsh, a 4th grade student in Mr. Belden’s class.” State the reason for the leave of absence, whether due to personal or medical reasons. Try to remain dispassionate, while still explaining the situation fully. Do this in 1 or 2 sentences, including the length of the proposed leave and dates you will be out.  For example, “Due to some recently discovered kidney stones, I will need surgery this month.

In this sensitive situation, explain how school is disrupting your ability to be well.  For example, you might say, “My declining mental health is disrupting my ability to participate in academic and campus life. I am respectfully requesting 1 month of leave, from September 8 to October 8, to address my depression in therapy at home.” If you are a parent writing on behalf of a student, you might say, “James is currently experiencing a mental health crisis and is not able to access needed services on campus. I am respectfully requesting 60 days of medical leave on his behalf, from October 17 to December 16, to receive treatment at an in-patient facility.” Make your formal leave request in 1 or 2 sentences. You can introduce any corroborating materials at this point, such as a professional opinion from a doctor or therapist.  For example, “Therefore, I ask for you to please consider my leave request as outlined above. I am enclosing a letter from my doctor for your reference.” If you are a parent writing on behalf of your child with a mental illness, you might say, “I kindly ask for you to consider this leave request due to these extenuating circumstances.

It was once associated primarily with overweight ponies, but it can affect any age or size of horse.  With this disease, the laminae weaken, which attach the pedal bone to the inside of the hoof. The horses pedal bone detaches from the inside of the hoof. Therefore, the pedal bone can turn, and sometimes, it even pushes through the sole. When it pushes through the sole, it's called \"founder.\" This bond is composed of a non-living layer and a sensitive living layer, much like nails and the nail beds. The detachment happens when this layer disconnects. The early stage of laminitis is called the acute stage. In this stage, the horse has developed laminitis, but the hoof hasn't detached yet.  Pay attention to your horse's mood. He may seem down, and his appetite may be less than normal.  He'll try to avoid exercise, as walking will be painful. He also might be standing differently than normal because he is trying to relieve the pain. For instance, he may push his front feet forward to relieve stress.  Look for changes in walking, such as not being able to turn easily, especially on hard surfaces. Even if he seems fine while walking on soft surfaces, how he acts on hard surfaces can be a dead giveaway. Also, the horse may want to shift from foot to foot all the time. The hoof may grow in differently, creating odd rings. Also, the white might grow out larger than normal in a ring. You may notice flaky hooves or hooves that are crumbly around the edges. Also, feel the hooves, as they may be warm to the touch during the early stages. When your horse is entering the early stages of laminitis, his heart and respiratory rate can begin to increase. The heart rate may move up to 60 to 120 beats per minute, while the respiratory rate may move to 80 to 100 breaths per minute. The subacute stage of laminitis is when the laminitis has gone past 3 days, but it still hasn't detached. Symptoms are actually less noticeable in this stage, but they are the same as the acute stage, such as increased heart rate and changed walking stance. His feet are painful so he wants to take the weight off them. A typical stance is to rock backwards, putting most of his weight on his heels. This makes the horse look as if he's leaning backwards. It is also difficult to get the horse to move. Having found a relatively comfortable way of standing, he's reluctant to move and cause pain.The chronic stage begins anytime the hoof detaches. Watch for the horse wanting to rest. If the horse wants to lay down or rest more often than normal, that can be a sign of a problem. Similarly, if the horse refuses to come out of his stall or is reluctant to walk, that is likely a sign that laminitis has reached the chronic stage.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Understand what Laminitis is.

Firewood can be heavy to carry from outside into your home, and this can be especially stressful during the colder months. Seek out an appropriate space away from the home to avoid infestations from termites and carpenter ants, but nearby enough for convenience. Keep in mind, if there aren't any appropriate spaces very close to your home, you can invest in a wheelbarrow to make transferring the firewood easier. When firewood is stored directly on the ground, it will rot quicker. Bacteria and bugs can get into the firewood, causing it to go bad. Look for a place off of soil.  Surfaces like concrete, asphalt, and clean gravel can be good surfaces for firewood. If you can't find any appropriate surfaces, you can use sticks to elevate firewood off of the ground. You can also lay down a tarp underneath firewood. If you have an outdoor storage shed, this a great place to store firewood. Inside a shed, firewood will be protected from things like rain. The shed will also provide a barrier between firewood and the soil. If possible, store firewood in an outdoor shed. Be careful of termites and carpenter ants taking up a home in wooden sheds as they can cause significant structural damage. You can also store firewood in your garage. Bugs, including termites and carpenter ants, can hitch a ride on the wood and cause significant property damage to wooden structures.   You can store firewood in an old trunk, if you have one. Some fireplaces have compartments built into the wall next to them where you can store firewood. Make sure firewood you store indoors is fully dry.

For this reason, it is important to schedule annual visits, or physicals, with your doctor to assess your risk of heart disease. You doctor can measure your blood pressure and order blood tests to look at cholesterol levels.  If any of these measurements are abnormal, she may prescribe medication that could be crucial for preventing a heart attack. You should start cholesterol screening no later than age 45. Medication that help with blood clots are called antiplatelet agents. Platelets are a component of the blood that are triggered to form blood clots when there is injury. Aspirin is the most commonly used medication in this group. It is a pill generally taken once a day in a dose of 81 to 325 mg. Side effects for regular use include stomach upset and, in rare cases, GI bleeding. Other types of antiplatelet agents include Plavix, Brilinta, and Effient. These are also pills that are generally taken once daily. The common side effect of taking these is easy bleeding and bruising. Cholesterol medications are called statins. They work by lowering bad cholesterol in your system and raising good cholesterol. This prevents the development of plaque in the heart. There are a number of different types, including Lipitor, Pravachol, Crestor, Mevacor, Altoprev,  Zocor, and Livalo. These are pills that are generally taken once daily.  In general, this class of medication is very safe and has very few and infrequent side-effects. Studies have suggested that they can rarely cause minor injury to the liver and kidneys. They can also cause muscle toxicity, injury and breakdown.   Statin therapy plays an especially important role in reducing cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. Frequently, lifestyle changes are not enough to reduce blood pressure to healthy levels and prescription medications must be used. Thiazide diuretics reduce fluid volume and cause relaxation of vessels in your heart. This medication is taken once daily. Side effects include low potassium, which can cause muscle weakness and irregular heartbeat, as well as low sodium, which can cause dizziness, vomiting, and fatigue. The most effective regimen for lowering blood pressure is a combination of both lifestyle changes and medication. Sometimes more than one type of medication is necessary. ACE inhibitors stop a hormone called Angiotensin II, which results in narrowed vessels and increased fluid retention in the heart. It is generally taken one to three times daily. Major side effects include low blood pressure, which can cause dizziness and fainting, elevated potassium, and cough. Up to 20% of patients taking an ACE inhibitor will develop a dry, hacking cough, generally within one to two weeks of starting the medication. There are three other types of medications that are classified as blockers. Beta blockers, alpha blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Alpha and beta blockers may be used if you do not respond to other medications. These work by blocking signals from nerves and hormones in the body that cause narrowed blood vessels. They are taken one to three times daily.  Side effects for beta blockers include cough and shortness of breath, low blood sugar, high potassium, depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Side effects for alpha blockers include headache, nausea, weakness, and weight gain.  Also try calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers are potent vasodilators, which work by relaxing the muscle in the wall of vessels. These are generally taken one to three times daily. Side effects include swelling in the lower extremities and decreased heart rate.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Visit your doctor to get assessed.

Don’t pester them if they refuse to forgive. You can’t make them change. Once you have apologized and asked for someone’s forgiveness, you must release yourself from the guilt. Even if they don’t forgive you, you’ve done your part in seeking to make amends. Once you are forgiven by God for your sin and by others for any hurt you caused, you must turn away from that sin. Make a conscious decision that you will not purposefully commit the same sin again after being forgiven.  You must remember that you will always sin again, but it’s important to say in the moment that you are turning away. The only way to get further from habitual sin is to tell yourself you are not going to do it again. Acts 2:38 is helpful in this process. It says, \"Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” Forgiveness is an important step, but walking away from sin is necessary, too, to remain close to God. Part of your goal in following Christ is to move further from sin, and this takes committed work. You won’t stop sinning immediately, but if you work on it, you will grow stronger.

If you use the European \"shake-hand\" grip, purchase the correct bat as opposed to the Asian \"pen-hold\" grip which has a shorter grip. When selecting your first bat, do not purchase a bat which is advertised as being extremely spinny and/or powerful, tempting though it may be. Know your level. If you don't, it will be detrimental to you as you begin playing. Your body needs to be balanced, relaxed, and ready to move in any direction. In fact, after every stroke, you should aim to return to ready position. Make sure your playing arm is ready to hit the ball, too.  If you have a better forehand, stand a little more to the left and vice versa if you have a stronger backhand. If you are right-handed, stand generally to you're left with your right foot slightly forward. If you are left handed, stand generally to your right with your left foot slightly forward.

A speedy opponent is often hard to beat. Stay reasonably fit. Go jogging and do some dynamic stretching before playing to warm your body and reflexes up. If you manage to get the ball to land in a corner, it is almost impossible to hit even for experienced players. Edges of the table work, too. However, if you're not skilled enough to aim the ball precisely, don't risk it. You could lose a point if the ball goes off the table. This can be a highly strategic move when combined with speed. One minute you're sending a fastball to the far edge of the table and the next you're sending a snail just in front of their net on the right ledge. Corners are especially tricky when your opponent doesn't know what to expect. Remember this rule: less space means less angle. The lower you send your ball over the net, the harder it is for your opponent to put some fancy angle on the ball. It will also be difficult for them to hit the ball with significant power. There is, however, an exception to this rule: lobs. In this case, send the ball incredibly high over the net and place it on the very edge of the table, encouraging your opponent to miss. There are many fouls and things that are considered points for the other team. For example, if you bounce the ball twice before it goes over it is a loss of point. Also in serving, it is compulsory to throw the ball up 6 inches (15.2 cm) above your hand or it is a foul. Don't know your fouls? Then you could lose the game anyway – sort of like not knowing that you can't scratch on the 8-ball in pool.

Schooling may or may not be necessary, but skilled labor is often in demand and you will find it fairly easy to find work.  For example, carpentry, auto repair, construction, and electrical work all benefit from people who are good at fixing things or working with their hands. These also tend to be stable, well-paying jobs. Other skills, such as a skill for cooking, can also be easily turned into a career. If your skills lie more in helping and communicating with other people, there are jobs for you as well. People who communicate and interact with others well can easily get careers as social workers or in marketing and similar business positions. If you’re more the type to take care of others, consider nursing or work as an administrative assistant or office manager. Sometimes it’s hard for us to see the areas in life where we excel. If you don’t think you’re good at anything, ask your parents, other family members, friends, or teachers what they think you’d be good at. Their ideas might surprise you!

Do you cancel plans because the other person had a rough day and needs to talk? If you’re doing these types of things for someone on a regular basis – for free – consider yourself being taken advantage of, unfortunately.  It's important to set boundaries when dealing with someone you think is taking advantage of you. Your boundaries should limit the impact their behaviors have on you. For example, you might tell them that you won't answer your phone after 9:00 p.m., even if it's an \"emergency.\" Be sure to follow through with consequences if they violate your boundaries.  Unless they are doing as much for you, even if in other ways, pull back on your support. You will likely meet resistance, so kindly explain your reasons. It’s in their hands at that point. Rent is due in three days, but your friend still hasn’t returned the $300 you lent her three weeks ago. A colleague “borrows” an idea, then basks in the glory when others rave about his or her brilliance. If someone is constantly borrowing from you but not returning (or crediting) what’s borrowed, that person is, essentially, stealing from you right under your nose. Stealing from you and using you are on the same side of the coin, which is not heads up for you.  In the case of borrowed items, ask the person to return what’s been borrowed before you lend anything else. If nothing’s returned, don’t loan again. In the case of borrowed ideas, decide if addressing the issue would create a bigger issue. If not, talk about it and in the future be careful about what you share and with whom. Pull out your calculators and add up how much the person is costing you. Is your partner living with you for free, or only paying the utility bills, for instance? Do you find yourself always picking up the restaurant bill when you’re out with your family? If your final calculation reveals a high figure, at a minimum your relationship isn’t balanced (maybe right along with your checkbook). At the most, you’re being used, both financially and emotionally. Now decide what you can afford, or if you want to continue assisting the other person at all.  For the big things like living expenses, let the other person know what you’ve decided, why you made the decision and both how and when you will implement the changes. For smaller things like picking up a bar tab, simply pay only your portion. If your friend conveniently “forgot” her wallet, the next time you meet for drinks slip in a sly, “Hey, don’t forget your wallet if you’re swapping purses again.” Now tally the number of dire emergencies, such as needing a truck to move furniture, that only you’re able to help with and the number of last minute but critical needs, such as pet sitting while the other person is on vacation, that only you can handle. Add to that the frequency at which the other is in the midst of some kind of drama and needs you, right now. Subtract how often he or she is there for you when you need someone to talk to or need help (particularly serious help), and the result will strongly correlate with whether or not you’re being used.  In fact, think back to the last time that person did you a favor without you asking. Or surprised you with a present, card or dinner. Now determine if your return on investment, or ROI, is paying off for you. Because you feel a need to be in the relationship, you might find yourself working harder to make it work, in spite of being and feeling used. Often you do so much that you fail to take care of your own needs. At times you convince yourself that it doesn’t bother you because you love the person or you feel the person needs you. Yet this feeling is typically fleeting because healthy relationships require a give and take. Other times you feel stuck because it’s a relationship you can’t easily avoid, like those at work or even those with certain family members.  Be careful that you don't adopt the persona of a caretaker or martyr. Taking care of other people may make you feel valuable and needed, and it can even meet some of your unmet needs. However, it's harmful for you in the long-run. When you find yourself wanting to please the other person, write down what you’re feeling, why you’re feeling this way and if doing what you planned to do for the other person will a) take away from what you need, b) go unappreciated and c) fail to solve the problem. If the answer to all three questions is yes, do something for yourself instead. When you recognize the imbalance in the relationship, and are no longer able to brush it off, you often begin feeling resentful. This may lead to feeling irritated with the other person. Depending upon your personality, that irritation can show itself in a variety of ways, some of which could result in consequences you may not want to pay, that could make you feel poorly about yourself or cause you to live with regret. To avoid reaching this point, talk calmly in a neutral environment with the other person about how you’re feeling resentful.

Most test kits in the United States measure the hardness in \"grains per gallon.\" Multiply this result by the gallons of water your household uses each day, on average (according to your water bill). This is the number of \"grains\" of hardness the device would soften each day. Choose a softener labeled for about 10 times this number of grains. This means the softener will work for about ten days before it needs some downtime.  The average US resident uses 100 gallons of water a day (or 70 gallons if you're only softening indoor water use).  For example, your household water hardness has 9 grains per gallon. You use 300 gallons per day, so 9 x 300 = 2,700 grains per day. A softener in the 27,000 grain range (2,700 x 10) is about the right size. Ion exchange softeners are by far the most effective home softener. Most other devices are much less effective, or even just scams. Ion exchange softeners come in two types:  Sodium chloride: the most common and most effective type. This adds a tiny amount of salt (sodium) to your water. Potassium chloride: less effective, but useful if you can't have sodium. The potassium can harm people with damaged kidneys or on certain medications that prevent potassium absorption.  If you don't want sodium or potassium, pick either type and install a reverse osmosis (RO) filter as well to remove them after softening. Once you've narrowed down the choice to some good models, look at the details. Many softeners refill themselves automatically, going offline for a while during this time. Some do this whenever the softening resin drops too low. Others can be set for a specific time once a week, so you're never caught with hard water unexpectedly. You can buy the softener in one go or lease it for a monthly payment. Besides reducing the upfront cost, leasing it usually comes with a professional installation, so you don't have to do it yourself. Try to get at least two quotes on the installation and lease. .

Don't shake the can of polyurethane, however, as this introduces more bubbles into the product. When you're finished stirring, pour the polyurethane into a paint tray. An 8 to 12 inch (20 to 31 cm) bristle brush is a good choice for this project. Avoid using lamb's wool pads, which collect dirt easily. Use long, even strokes to apply a thin coat of the polyurethane to the floor.  Avoid “flooding” the area with polyurethane -- you want a thin coat. Avoid going over the same spot multiple times, as this causes bubbles and imperfections. To avoid stepping on the surfaces you've already applied polyurethane to, it's important to start in the farthest corner from the entrance to the room and work your way toward the door. Aim to apply the polyurethane quickly, working from one end of the room to the other. Read the directions on the package to find out how long the polyurethane you're using  takes to dry. Typically, you'll be able to sand and apply another coat within 4 to 8 hours, though some varieties may take up to 12 hours to dry. Once the floor is dry, use 220-grit sandpaper to sand down imperfections. Make sure you sand along the lines of the natural grain, rather than against the grain. For smaller troublesome spots, use 320- or 400-grit sandpaper. Clean water-based polyurethane with mild soap and water. Use mineral spirits or paint thinner to clean oil-based polyurethane. Apply the cleaner with a soft cloth and wipe it dry when finished. For the second coat, you should thin the polyurethane so that it is less likely to create bubbles. Combine 10 parts polyurethane with 1 part mineral spirits (for oil-based polyurethane) or 1 part water (for water-based polyurethane) in a clean can and stir it thoroughly. Then, pour it into a paint tray. You will likely notice that some spots have a thicker layer of polyurethane on them than others. To ensure you have an even coat and seal, apply a thinned coat of polyurethane to the entire floor using the same method as before. Again, you'll need to wait until this coat is dry before moving on. Refer back to the instructions included with the polyurethane to determine the drying time. Don't rush this step, or your floor can get gummed up or ruined. Steel wool, grade 0000, works well for this. Use the fine steel wool to go over the entire surface of the floor, to remove imperfections as well as ensure the entire coating is even and level. Using the same method as before, wipe down the floor to remove dust or debris. Allow the floor to dry fully before adding the final coat of polyurethane. Use full-strength polyurethane for the final coat. Avoid cleaning or sanding this coat of polyurethane. Instead, stay out of the room until it has set completely. You shouldn't walk on the floor for 24 hours after applying the final coat. Don't replace your furniture for 72 hours and wait at least 1 week before cleaning the floor or arranging rugs on it.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Stir the polyurethane and pour it into a paint tray.

If not, are you likely to fix it in the next year? Is the item valuable, or does it have sentimental value? Whatever you end up putting in the \"unusable\" pile, get rid of it as soon as possible. Don't take it to the dump \"next time you get around to it,\" do it right now. Clearing out the clutter is the only way to commit to a more organized and efficient work space in your garage. If you don't need it, don't keep it around to take up premium space.  Throw away broken or damaged items that are beyond repair and give away duplicate items or outdated items that you've replaced with newer models. You might consider giving away an old busted socket set if you've got a newer set yourself. Recycle scrap metal and other valuable stuff you might find lying around the garage.  Consider a garage sale. If your garage is packed to the gills with old Halloween decorations, stacks of Rolling Stone from the mid-80s, and trash-bags full of kids clothes, it's probably time to throw some price stickers on the junk and have a yard sale. After evaluating all the usable items, clean them up as well as possible. Don't put away dirty tools, muddy soccer cleats, and otherwise compromised gear into new, neatly organized places. Spend time committing to clean.  If it's been a couple years since you've cleaned up around the space, reorganization is a good opportunity to do just that. Clean the floors with disinfectant and address the dust that's built up over the years. Using a bit of acetone is a great way of quickly cleaning up old stainless steel tools that have been laying around collecting grease. Use an old rag and a small amount of acetone in a well-ventilated area.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Commit to a bigger mess.

So, you can simply peel 2 or 3 cucumbers and leave the peelings around the edges of the patio.

If you’re invested in keeping bees away from your house for a longer time, you could plant one or more cucumber plants in a garden near your house, or in a pot outdoors. Bees are naturally repelled by marigolds, so the bright flowers will keep them from flying too close to your outdoor activities. If you’re hosting a large social event, and guests will be spread over a large area, try setting up half a dozen marigold plants around the area you’d like to keep bee-free. If you want to ensure that bees are kept away from your house for many summers, try planting marigolds in pots or planters on your patio, deck, or outside windowsill. Bees are deterred by a number of common herbs, and will not come near areas where these herbs (and their potent smells) are present. Bee-deterring herbs include peppermint, cinnamon, vanilla, and garlic. So, consider putting a few peppermint plants or cinnamon sticks around your picnic area or outdoor patio.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Every state has specific laws surrounding whether prenuptial agreements are allowed and, if so, what types of things cannot be included in them. Generally speaking, you cannot include any of the following in a prenuptial agreement:  Restrictions on child support, custody, or visitation; Giving up rights to alimony; Encouragements to divorce; and Rules about non-financial matters (e.g., who will do chores, whether you will have pets, who will take the child to school). This will help identify each asset properly in the event you become divorced and the prenuptial agreement is reviewed in a court of law. Include locations and addresses of all your properties; bank account names and numbers; the make, model, and year of any vehicles you own; and explicit descriptions of any valuable belongings in your possession, such as cuts of diamonds on jewelry, or the names of artists for paintings you own. Since you are filing a prenuptial agreement, both parties must disclose all their financial assets and debts in the event the agreement is challenged in court. Each person will bring into the marriage their own property and/or assets. In your prenuptial agreement, you should identify the specific property that will remain in the sole possession of its original owner in the event the marriage ends.  Also consider what will happen in the event an asset increases in value over the course of a marriage (i.e., if the value of your collectible car appreciates dramatically in value over the course of the next ten years).  Be as specific as you can when referring to each asset. There should be no room for confusion regarding the property to which a particular provision of the agreement refers. Include assets or provisions that deal only with finances and property, such as businesses, vehicles, homes, valuable jewelry, antiques, properties you own, savings accounts, stocks, and inheritances. Be sure to keep separate property in the original owner's name only throughout the duration of the marriage, or this may override the prenuptial agreement. For example, \"The following shall constitute the Parties' Separate Property: The property listed on Schedule A as [Partner 1's] property and on Schedule B as [Partner 2's] property, which schedules are annexed hereto and made part hereof.\" The \"schedules\" would be separate, attached documents that detail specific property for each person. After you have decided which property to keep separate, you can also identify in the agreement the property that will be shared between both partners during the marriage. This is called marital property.  You should also detail how assets acquired over the course of the marriage will be divided in the event the marriage ends.  For example, \"The following shall constitute the Parties' Marital Property: All property acquired during the marriage until the occurrence of a Termination Event [divorce, separation, annulment, etc.] that is not Separate Property as set forth in the previous section [that details specific property that will be kept separate].\" Also consider what will happen with any debts that either person brings into the marriage. The agreement can provide that a person is solely responsible for debts he or she brings into the marriage, or it can provide that certain debts will be paid for with marital property. For example, \"Obligations [debts] of a party incurred prior to the marriage shall remain the separate obligations of that party. The other party shall not be liable for those obligations, and shall be indemnified and held harmless from them by the responsible party. Such existing obligations shall be paid from the separate property of the responsible party.\" You can also use a prenuptial agreement to establish how a partner will survive financially if he or she will be staying at home to take care of any children. It can also outline any financial support, if any, that will be paid by either person to the other in the event of a divorce.  For example, \"In the event of a legal separation, divorce, or annulment, the parties agree to waive any rights to spousal support or maintenance of any kind to which either might otherwise be entitled. The parties agree that this provision may be entered as a complete defense by either party in response to an action for alimony.\"  This is also a good time to include provisions relating to children from previous marriages, if this situation applies to you. The agreement can detail what support will be given to any minor children in the event of a divorce. This is a particularly contested issue in the event of a divorce. It will be helpful to decide now what will happen to the home you and your partner share if the marriage ends. Think about who will get it or, if it will be sold, how the proceeds from the sale will be divided. For example, \"In the event of a Termination Event: The marital home shall be placed on the market for sale within one year from the date of the Termination Event and the net proceeds of the sale shall be distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. [Partner 1 or 2] has the right to remain in the marital residence up to one (1) year following a Termination Event.\" You can also include provisions in the prenuptial agreement relating to how large purchases will be made, who will handle shared finances, who will pay household bills, and if you will maintain separate or joint bank accounts. In the prenuptial agreement, you can outline how you and your partner will pay any taxes either of you owe. For example, you can decide whether you will file jointly or separately, or what will be done about pre-existing tax debt for which either person is liable. While divorce is by no means an eventuality for you and your partner, one of the major benefits of having a prenuptial agreement is avoiding argument in the case of a divorce. In your agreement, detail how property will be divided in the event of a split, otherwise the law of your state will decide for you.  For example, \"In the event of a Termination Event: Each Party shall retain his or her Separate Property, and the other Party agrees not to make any claim in or to such property. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all Martial Property shall be divided between the Parties in accordance with [state law].\"  Be aware that while you can attempt to include provisions relating to alimony in the agreement, not all states allow this. The prenuptial agreement does not have to last forever. You can indicate how long you want it to last using what is known as a \"sunset clause\" to specify a future date on which the agreement is no longer valid. In addition, you may choose to outline any conditions that relate to who ends the marriage or why the marriage ends.  You can also detail when and how the prenuptial agreement can be renegotiated at a later date. For example, \"This Agreement may not be amended or revoked except by an instrument in writing signed by both of the parties and acknowledged and witnessed with the same formalities of this Agreement, expressly modifying or revoking one or more or all of the provisions of this Agreement.\"  Be aware, however, that states are not likely to give much weight to any sections of a prenuptial agreement that mandate certain consequences for a person based on his or her degree of \"fault\" (like having an affair). While courts presume prenuptial agreements to be legal, they can be challenged and thrown out if they do not protect both people adequately. After you have drafted the agreement, make sure to keep the following in mind while finalizing it:  Make sure each person has fully disclosed all assets and debts. Make sure neither person has pressured the other to sign, and that each person has had enough time to fully consider the agreement before signing it. Make sure the agreement considers each person. Don't try to take advantage of the other person or try to leave them with less than they deserve if the marriage ends. Make sure both people have an opportunity to have their own lawyer read it before they sign. Though the requirements vary by jurisdiction, a prenuptial agreement is a legal document and therefore you must meet certain conditions for the document itself to be legally valid:  It should be in writing. It should be dated and signed by both you and your partner. Some states require one or two witnesses to the signing of the document. Both you and your partner should visit a notary public in person, each testify to the document's authenticity, and then get the document officially notarized. Make sure you have at least three copies for your records—one for each person and another to give to a third-party or save in a shared secure location.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Research your state's laws.

One way to maintain a healthy body is to eat healthy foods. Eat whole foods such as lean meats, nuts, fruits, and vegetables.  Who knows, you might even develop a passion for cooking that builds your self-esteem and turns into a hobby that helps to keep you drug free. Too much caffeine can make you jittery and anxious which can contribute to feelings of stress and make you more likely to turn to using (other) drugs to counteract the anxiety that the caffeine produced. A lack of sleep can contribute to poor mental health such as by causing feelings of fatigue, sadness, and anxiety, all of which may add to your likelihood of using drugs in order to avoid feeling bad. Practice relaxation techniques to help stay mentally and physically healthy. Relaxation techniques reduce the impact of stress on your body by negating negative feelings and negative bodily sensations such as muscle tension. Stress is a common reason that people begin using drugs, so managing your stress will help you stay drug-free.  Try visualization. This technique involves forming peaceful and relaxing mental images. For example, picture a calm ocean and try to imagine it with all of your senses; think about how it would smell, how the wind and sun would feel against your skin.

Many doctors and pharmacists are not trained about supplements and natural products. Ask your healthcare practitioner something like, “How familiar are you with these natural supplements?” If they do not have extensive knowledge, ask for a referral to a dietitian or other professional who does. When buying natural supplements, know the difference between pills, capsules, powders, teas, and the variety of other forms supplements may come in.

That way, if you do encounter any difficulties with taking your supplements, you can go directly to the source with your questions and complaints.

Look for a seal from the US Pharmacopeia (USP) or NSF International. This means that the supplement manufacturer should adhere to quality guidelines created by these regulatory organizations. Supplements can be made with natural ingredients or they can be synthesized in a laboratory.  Synthetic products may be more likely to contain harmful additives or by-products. Look for supplements labeled “natural” and avoid those called “synthetic” – contact the manufacturer for this information if it is not listed on the bottle. For instance, vitamin E may be listed as d-alpha-tocopherol if natural and dl-alpha-tocopherol if synthetic. Supplements contain many ingredients other than the herb or vitamin they intend to, and not all of them are bad. Try to generally avoid those with added sugar, which may be listed as an ingredient ending in “-ose.” You may also want to avoid added cornstarch, yeast, soy, and whey.  Many dyes will be listed in the ingredients as a color then a number, such as “yellow no. 5.” Other ways they may be listed are simply as “FD&C,” or “E” then a number like “E102.” Every so often a new fad supplement appears on the market, or lists itself as a “cure all” remedy. These are likely just marketing ploys, and just because many people are taking a supplement doesn’t mean it’s right for you. In general, it’s better to wait awhile after a new supplement appears on the market so the FDA can begin to collect safety data on it.

Make an effort to buy only products and services that were made with an eye for the environmental health of the planet. Avoid buying from companies with practices that threaten global biodiversity. Remember, companies will sell what people want to buy, so tell companies that you want products that do not harm biodiversity. Research environmentally friendly brands before you make major purchases. For starters, this Fortune report lists a good selection of responsible companies. \" There's no way around it: Since early in our history, humans have always created a lot of garbage. Today, however, the massive amounts of waste being produced on a global scale pose a major threat to biodiversity. By following the \"Three Rs,\" you can minimize the impact of your waste. The \"Three Rs\" are:   Reduce: Decrease your consumption. Don't buy products you don't need. When you do buy things, try to make choices that generate a minimal amount of garbage. For instance, buy things with limited packaging (or none at all) rather than things that come in many boxes or containers. The less garbage you generate, the less you'll contribute to the loss of biodiversity when natural habitats are used for landfills.  Reuse: Decrease the amount of goods you throw away by using  things more than once. One easy example is bringing a backpack or a reusable bag to the grocery store so that you don't use new bags. See our Home Organization articles for more great ideas. Again, less garbage means less loss of biodiversity from expanding landfills.  Recycle: When you do have to throw something away, recycle it so it can be converted to something useful again rather than being added to a landfill. Click here for a good guide to recycling in the U.S. There are numerous other ways to encourage global biodiversity. Best of all, many of these are things you can do in and around the home! For instance, reducing your reliance on commercial crops decreases natural habitat destruction when cleared for farming. See below for a few easy suggestions.   Start a family or community garden. Less demand for large-scale agriculture means less habitat loss and fewer native species displaced. Use composting at home. The compost can be added to the family garden or the community garden to boost your harvest. This further reduces your reliance on commercial agriculture. Even better, this is a great way to recycle organic waste and kitchen scraps! We've all heard it hundreds of times: Burning fossil fuels is bad for the environment. While human carbon emissions have been linked to global climate change beyond a shadow of a doubt, many don't know that they also have a direct impact on the planet's biodiversity. Climate change leads to habitat loss and more stressful environmental conditions that put at-risk species on the brink of extinction. Thus, slowing climate change by reducing emissions is one effective way to preserve biodiversity. Usually, this can be done by reducing the energy we use. For instance, you might try:  Purchasing a zero- or reduced-emissions car for your next vehicle purchase. Carpooling during your daily commute to save money and reduce the fuel you consume. Walking or riding your bike instead of driving. Using energy-efficient electronics to reduce carbon emissions. In the U.S., electronics that are made to use a minimal amount of electricity are given an \"ENERGY STAR\" label by the EPA. Look for this label.

Try on the speedo in the store before you buy it. You may need to wear it over underwear or use a disposable liner in the speedo. Make sure the speedo is not too tight or constricting. It should feel snug but the fabric should not dig into your skin. Walk around, squat, and sit in the speedo to ensure it is comfortable. If it feels comfortable on you, you will likely be more confident wearing it around. Go for a dark, neutral color like black, navy, or brown if you do not want to call too much attention to yourself when you are wearing the speedo. If you have a lighter skin tone, you may opt for a warm color like brown or a burnt orange. If you have a darker skin tone, a cooler color like navy or gray may be ideal. When in doubt, black is a good, neutral color for the speedo. It can also be more slimming and flattering.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Get a speedo made of high quality, long lasting fabric.

Extroverts are more likely to “Do, Think, Do” pattern, while their introverted counterparts take more time to think before taking an action. No way is better than the other, but knowing how you personally think will help you streamline your own thinking patterns. Self-awareness has been tied to leadership, and leadership often reflects a person's ability to think on one's feet. You can become more self-aware by practicing self-reflection techniques. Being more self-aware will help you better understand the environment around you, and make it easier to think of solutions or answer more quickly. How to Self Reflect  Use a journal to write down your thoughts, feelings and reactions to mental stimuli throughout your day. Understand how you solve problems by considering each step you take Think about what emotions you feel during day to day tasks (I.e. Do you feel frustration while performing a specific task at work?) Think about why you might be feeling that emotion. To more effectively think on your feet, you need to gather as much information as possible about the situation you are in. One simple way of doing this is by asking questions about the task at hand. This will help you compile more information and help to educate you on a particular situation. Ask things like:  “I hear that you want a report written about this client. What are you concerned about, specifically?” ”You seem to be asking me about a project we finished last week. What was it that you wanted to know about it?” ”What do you mean by what you said?” (This can help you get not only a clearer understanding of what was said, but also give the speaker to think about what s/he wants from you). By being critical of presented information, you are more likely to pick up on weak points of a situation. This may help you to see solutions quicker.  Don't take everything at face value. If you are asked to do a specific task or answer a specific question, try to gather as much facts about the situation before you make a decision. While the goal is to think quickly and on your feet, you still want to be accurate and understanding. If you are asked to think on your feet by giving an answer to something that seems to be too good to be true (for example, a sale) be skeptical!

Construct an anxiety hierarchy to help you better understand your fears.  Constructing an anxiety hierarchy starts with a list of situations where the anxiety is felt. After the list is complete, you then rank them from the lowest level of anxiety all the way to the one situation with the highest level of stress. The final list would normally contain between 10 and 20 items that begin with something that brings on so little anxiety is almost does not bother you to the one situation that gives you the most anxiety. For example, an anxiety hierarchy for talking to your boss might look like this:  Saying hi to the boss in the hall Talking to the boss in her office in a neutral situation Answering a direct question from the boss when put on the spot Talking to the boss about a negative situation While you may hear from some people the best thing to do is to ignore the fear, it is actually better to break down what is actually making you fearful and take small steps to work through that.  If you are fearful of being in front of an audience, take a small step like making an effort to speak up at a meeting in front of a small group of other employees. Work your way up to slightly larger groups. If the fear is more related to speaking in front of strangers, a first small step could be as simple as making a call to a wrong number on purpose simply to force yourself to talk to a stranger. Build from there by starting a conversation with a stranger waiting in line at a coffee shop. If you fear speaking up in class, go through the motions of envisioning yourself doing this. Practice how you would handle the situation and prepare as much as you can on the subject so you are ready to speak up without fear of the subject.  Practice and role play the situation that is intimidating. Become very familiar with whatever subject you are talking about so it becomes easier and almost second nature to talk about the subject. This will help with your fear of forgetting the topic. Making sure you feel confident in the subject will also allow you to focus on the topic instead of the audience. You do not want to totally ignore the audience since you need to be aware of their reactions, but focusing on your mastery of the topic will take some of the focus off the audience. This would include a combination of deep breathing, visual imagery and other methods discussed in this article. As you are imagining your fears, you are likely to experience anxiety. Use the techniques you have learned to return to a state of calm. Over time, the anxiety-provoking situation won't affect you as much. Avoid waiting to speak in front of a group until it is critical to your job or school life. Give yourself time to succeed and testing grounds to make mistakes without the worry of messing up the “big speech”. Learn to work with your fear instead of trying to hide it. When you try to hide the fear you may find yourself overcome by internal negative self speak that is almost always far worse than what the audience is actually thinking.

Girls love it when this happens. After you've texted her for a while and you think she's good enough friends with you, try to ask her who she likes. Make sure she asks you too, otherwise it will most likely end up being a different guy. Also try to make it late—that's extra cute! Do you have common interests? Are you around the same age? If you are going to date this girl, make sure that she is someone with whom you actually want to spend a lot of time. It is easy to build up unrealistic fantasies in your head, but it isn't always easy to gauge whether you would truly be happy with someone.

How the virus affects the body is not fully known, however, chikungunya and dengue have almost identical symptoms and disease processes. Chikungunya infects the muscle cells of the body. From there, it reproduces until the cell dies, and then replicates and finds a new host cell to infect. The incubation period of the chikungunya is 1 to 12 days. Chikungunya usually attacks the muscles, joints, skin, connective tissues, and even the central nervous system. Because chikungunya is a systemic infection, it is usually accompanied by fever and skin rash.  The skin rashes are almost identical to the rashes that are present in a case of dengue and is a result of damage to the blood vessels. Fever occurs as the body raises its temperature in an attempt to kill the infectious agent. As a consequence of the fever, you may suffer from a headache, nausea, and vomiting. Because the virus destroys cells in the muscles and joints, you will experience muscle weakness and joint pain. Joint and muscle pain can be severe and acute. Partial loss of taste is reported by many chikungunya patients. This happens because the virus attacks nerve endings on the tongue and desensitizes the taste buds. Acquiring an accurate diagnosis is very important to get the right treatment.  A virus isolation is the most conclusive exam used to diagnose chikungunya. However, it takes 1 to 2 weeks before it is completed and should be done in a biosafety level 3 lab, which is not available in many developing countries where chikungunya is prevalent. The technique involves acquiring a blood sample from the patient and then introducing the virus to it. The blood sample will then be observed for specific responses.  RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) makes the genes of chikungunya more pronounced and shows evidence of the disease. The result can be obtained in 1-2 days.

Even after asserting your boundaries, you may find yourself in frequent power struggles. Try to keep your expectations in check. You will probably always have issues with a controlling person, so don't expect a huge change. You can't change another person. Even if you've tried your best to address how their behavior is harmful, a controlling person will not change unless they want to. When interacting with a controlling person, remind yourself you will probably have to restate boundaries and tune out criticism. Controlling people usually have something going on under the surface. Underlying interpersonal issues, such as a tendency towards insecurity, often manifest in a need for control. When being confronted by a controlling person, remind yourself it's not about you. You are probably not doing anything wrong in the situation. The other person just has an intense need for control.  If you know why the person is controlling, try to remind yourself of this in the moment. This can help you remember it isn't about you. For example, \"I know my dad is very demanding about my career choices, but his dad was the same way. He doesn't know how to trust me to make my own decisions. It's not about me.\" Try to look at the types of requests and demands they are making. Are they always about a particular issue, such as cleanliness or punctuality? If so, the person may just have certain preferences and needs. If the problem is more widespread, they may have control issues. This is especially important if you have to interact with a controlling person on a regular basis. For example, if you live with a controlling person or a controlling romantic partner, remind yourself self-care is necessary. When you're catering to the needs of someone who has to constantly be in control, you may neglect your own personal care.  You have a right to care for yourself. You're allowed to give yourself time to exercise, eat right, engage in fun hobbies, and do things that make you happy. Work on making time for your own personal needs, even if you have to tune out criticism to do so. For example, you work early in the morning and need to get a full night's sleep. Your controlling boyfriend expects you to go to bed at the same time he does, but he stays up very late. Go to bed when you want and, if he gives you a hard time, tune it out and then remind him you need to be up in the morning. Sometimes, the easiest way to deal with a controlling person is to get away from them. Work on avoiding the person if your interactions with them have become upsetting for you. This will make your life a lot easier.  If you live with a controlling person, try to limit your time with them to meal times and other short spurts together. If you work with a controlling person, try to limit your time with that person in the office. For example, you might keep your conversations to small talk and try to choose projects that do not require teaming up with this person. If you have a controlling family member, limit interactions with them at family events. Keep things like phone calls as brief as possible.

Instead, it has three functions: to reduce bitterness, enhance sweetness and to heighten the aromas and natural tastes of other ingredients. While not all dishes need salt, it generally enhances the overall flavor of most so they don’t taste flat.  If you have a dish that tastes flat or bitter, try adding a three-fingered pinch of salt before anything else. Taste it again. If it’s still not right, add a little more and give it another taste. That might be all it takes. If not, proceed to balancing in other ways. Salt absorbs into food as it sits. If you add too much salt, you can try increasing the sweet or sour components or by diluting the dish a bit with water.  You can also try to compensate by adjusting the side dishes. For example, don’t salt the rice or add a sweet or sour side dish.  To avoid over-concentration when reducing liquids, add salt after the liquid is reduced. The taste of sweet is a great contrast to sour and salty tastes. It can help balance dishes with ingredients having these tastes or if a dish’s flavor becomes too salty or sour. While the sweet taste in most foods comes from sugars – cane sugar (granulated, turbinado, brown, powdered, bakers, fruit, etc.) and beet sugar – it can also come from molasses, maple syrup, honey, carrots, mango and other sweet foods. So consider these as alternatives when creating your recipes.  Sweet really benefits from sour, which is why a squeeze of lemon juice over a fruit salad or cream cheese frosting on cake work so well together.  Unfortunately, because people are consuming more and more packaged foods that often have a lot of high fructose corn syrup and the like, we have become more tolerant of sweetness and require more of it to taste it. At many restaurants, bottles of vinegar are sitting on the table and lemon wedges are served on the side with a number of entrees. That’s because sour as a taste brings out the natural flavors in foods. It also balances sweetness and spiciness and enhances saltiness. It’s generally found in acidic foods like limes, lemons, oranges, sour cream, yogurt and pickled veggies. It’s also in vinegars like balsamic, sherry, red, apple cider and rice. Many other fruits are also classified as sour: raspberries, blueberries, red currants and grapes.  If a dish is too sour, add something sweet or something with fat to balance it.  Sour also helps to balance foods that are too spicy. Bitter is offensive at best and inedible at worst when used in large quantities or when not balanced. But when in harmony with other tastes, particularly sweetness, it adds depth and richness to food. It’s tarty edge also perks up the taste buds. Chocolate and coffee are naturally bitter, as are olives; greens like radicchio, arugula, dandelion and kale; hops; bitter melon; brussel sprouts; turnips; chicory; and grapefruit. Pomegranate juice is used often as well. Experiment with adding arugula, chicory and endive to your salads; thicken sauces with unsweetened chocolate; or deglaze with a bitter liqueur Campari instead of a juice or stock. The last taste discovered, umami, is described as savory or mouthwatering, though there’s not an exact translation from Japanese to English. It amplifies the flavor of a dish and is found in a variety of meats, such as beef, pork, chicken, and cured ham; vegetables, such as shitake mushrooms, truffles, Chinese cabbage, soy beans, and sweet potatoes; seafood, such as prawns, squid, tuna, mackerel, seaweed, and shellfish; and cheeses like parmesan, Gruyere, and Swiss. It’s also in green tea, tomatoes and soy sauce. Bacon also triggers the umami taste.  Aging, curing, ripeness and fermenting all enhance umami.  Going overboard is difficult to correct. The best way is typically to add more ingredients that are not umami-rich. While spicy, floral, earthy, minty, buttery, fruity and so forth aren’t technically tastes in the sense that they aren’t processed by our taste buds, they are tastes in the sense that they are notes in foods that we identify with dishes. For example, if something becomes too spicy, you can balance it with a sweet taste. Think of Mexican chocolate with its pinch of cayenne pepper.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Learn the functions of salt.

Make sure that you check with the universities to which you are applying to determine their prerequisites. In addition to the intellectual capacity for rigorous work, students will require strong emotional health to deal with the human aspect of medicine. This is why medical schools look at students' applications holistically, which means that they consider what you do in your free time in addition to your performance in the classroom. To show that you have developed the broad skill-set necessary to succeed in medical school – and the kind of work-life balance that fosters a healthy temperament in the workplace – engage in a range of extracurricular activities.

This will allow you to inspect the flapper without having the toilet running constantly.  The flapper is a round rubber seal that stops water from draining from the tank and into the toilet bowl. When you flush the toilet, the chain pulls the flapper up so fresh water can fill the bowl. Problems with the flapper are among the most common causes of a running toilet. Lay down a towel somewhere safe and out of the way, such as in a corner. Hold either end of the lid firmly with both hands and pull the lid off the toilet. Place the lid on the towel to prevent it from getting scratched. Toilet lids are made of heavy ceramic, so don’t place them anywhere they can easily be knocked over. The chain that pulls the flapper up can cause problems if it’s too long or too short. When the chain is too short, it will pull up on the valve when it shouldn’t, allowing water to drain constantly. When the chain is too long, it can get caught underneath the flapper and prevent a seal.  If there's too much tension on the chain, remove the hook attaching the chain to the flush lever. Move the hook up 1 or 2 links until the chain has more slack. Reattach the hook to the flush lever. If the chain is so long that it can get caught under the valve, use a pair of wire cutters to trim a few links from the top of the chain. Reattach the hook to the new top link and reattach it to the flush lever. Remove the flapper by unhooking the sides from the pins at the bottom of the overflow tube, which is the open tube in the center of the tank. Inspect the flapper for mineral deposits, warping, discoloration, disintegration, and other signs of trouble.  You can clean a dirty flapper that’s got mineral buildup on it. A flapper that shows other wear-related problems should be replaced. Mineral deposits from the water can build up on the flapper and prevent it from sealing properly, allowing water to run. To clean the flapper, soak it in a bowl of vinegar for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, scrub the rubber with an old toothbrush to dislodge buildup and dirt.   Alternatively, put a few drops of baby shampoo on a rag and use it to wipe down the flapper. This will clean the flapper and add more elasticity to the rubber. When the flapper is clean, put it back in place. Attach the hooks on the side to the pins on the overflow tube. Turn the water back on and let the toilet tank fill. Listen for the sound of water running to see if that fixed the problem. If the flapper is brittle and hard or doesn’t seal well after cleaning it, purchase a new one. Take the worn flapper to the hardware store and purchase a new flapper in the same style and with the same dimensions. You can also buy a universal flapper that will fit any kind of toilet.  To attach the new flapper, fit in into place and attach the hooks on the side to the pins on the overflow tube.

For example, to the neighbor’s drive-way. Mark this location on your escape plan. Assign one person who will be responsible for helping anyone who would not be able to get out of the home on their own. For example, if you have a baby, young toddler, or an elderly family member. Make sure this person knows that it is their responsibility. If you have young children, post the fire exit plan in their room to help them remember what the plan is. Have every family member practice the exit routes from each room at least once or twice a year. Instruct each member of the household on what to do if they notice a fire.  For example, if someone notices a fire they should yell or pound on the walls to alert other members of the household. Instruct family members to feel doors before opening them. If the door is hot, they should use an alternative route as specified in the fire exit plan. Explain that if there is heavy smoke, household members should crawl on the floor to avoid smoke inhalation. Inspect each door and window in your home. Are there objects that would make it difficult to get out of these exits in the event of a fire? If a fire happens, you want as many possible ways to get out of the house as possible, so make sure that there is nothing that would keep you or your loved ones from getting out safely. For example, don’t allow a tall, heavy dresser to block the window. If a fire happens, you or your loved one may not be strong enough to push it out of the way in time. You should conduct a fire drill at least once. Don’t tell anyone that you are setting off the alarm so that it will be treated like the real thing, rather than as a drill.

You don't have to go skydiving if it's not your thing, but you should accept invitations from people you're just getting to know, try a new cuisine you didn't even know existed, or take a last-minute road trip to hike a beautiful mountain. Don't just do the same old thing and make a goal of doing something completely new at least once a week.  Being edgy requires you to fill your life with new ideas, people, and places. To stay on the cutting edge of ideas, you need to constantly be exposed to them! Start small, if you're feeling timid. Book a single vacation, take up the new hobby you've wanted to try, or try out a new bar or party. This may sound like it has nothing to do with an edge, but finding your dreams and going after them have everything to do with being confident and cool. Being edgy means looking at everything a little differently, doing your own thing, and being okay with the fact that it may not fit the world's idea of what you should be doing with your life. Pablo Picasso, Albert Einstein, and Coco Chanel were all edgy in their own ways, even if they only seemed eccentric or \"different\" at the time. They succeeded because they kept trying.  Whatever your dreams are, be confident and comfortable about following them. So what if you want to be an actress or to publish a killer novel while knowing there's a good chance it won't happen for you? Following your dreams, however impractical they are, will give you some edge. And if you don't know what your dreams are, then now is a good time to find out. You can't really be edgy if you're feeling aimless or like you're just plugging along instead of following a passion. Do things even if the result may be consequential. Unless you have reason to fear for your life and safety, sometimes you need to just \"do it for the story.\" Edgy people understand that things won't always go perfectly in the moment, but that these challenges and tribulations are the bases of many incredible, edge-of-your-seat stories later on in life. Though having goals is important, it's also important to sit at the top of a cliff once in a while. Make every experience matter. Do some things just because they feel right. It's okay if you don't rush downstairs to greet your roommate the second she walks in the house or tear your eyes off your captivating book the moment your crush walks by. Get engrossed. Get obsessed. Get completely absorbed. It's okay to be so focused that you don't completely notice what's going on around you; what's most important is that you're committed to caring about whatever makes you excited about being alive. Whenever you do something, give your full attention and effort to the task. You'll not only be edgier, but you'll learn faster and have more meaningful experiences. Edgy people don't just roll over when challenged. If someone calls you out, gossips about you, or even says something nasty about you to your face, don't back off. You don't have to start a fight or start name-calling, but you should be proud enough to be yourself that you know you're worth defending. Don't let anyone think he can get away with putting you down. You'll find that most people, when challenged, will back down. Don't feel the need to pursue or punish them if they do -- you've already won the battle. If you want to be edgy, you have to be on the cutting edge of things. This means you should see the new Sundance Film Festival winner, that you should check out the new Burmese restaurant everyone has been raving about, and that you should update your hair and fashion more than once every five years. It also means that you should actually watch the news, read the papers, and be able to carry an intelligent conversation about what's going on in the world.  Being up-to-date doesn't mean you have to copy every trend that comes your way. There's a difference between being aware of trends and following them obsessively. You can never be current about every topic. Instead, get deeply immersed in the topics that mean the most to you, following your passion. If you run next to someone who is faster than you, you will run faster. If you run next to someone who is way slower, your body will naturally slow down. The same goes for being edgy. If you know someone who is the height of edginess, who you deeply respect and admire and want to emulate, then keep on hanging with that person.  If you know a group of people who likes to stay up late talking about Marxism, going green, or whatever it is that excites you, then make a habit of hanging out with them more. You don't have to think of them as your \"edgy\" friends.

This makes them ideal as a quick snack that can be stored for a long time without fear of spoiling.  You can use a toaster, toaster oven, or traditional oven to heat up your frozen English muffin. Frozen English muffins that are allowed to thaw out are typically fine to use, although they tend to be soggy. Warming them in a toaster or an oven is ideal, as opposed to eating them without warming. Some toasters have a setting that is made specifically for heating up frozen foods. It simply adds a bit of time to the toasting cycle so that the English muffin gets totally warmed up on the inside and toasted on the outside. A frozen English muffin will take a little longer to cook or toast than one that wasn't frozen. However, the time difference is typically less than a minute.  If you are unsure how long to cook your English muffin, use your usual amount of time. You can then add a minute or 2 if your muffin isn't cooked thoroughly. Toasting a plain frozen English muffin will usually take about 3-4 minutes, depending on your specific toaster. If you'd like to warm up your plain English muffin in the oven, set it to 300 °F (149 °C) and bake it for 15 minutes. An English muffin sandwich will take twice as long to heat through. Wrapping the frozen English muffin in a paper towel will help keep the right level of moisture in it.

Take note of the happiest moments in your life, and prioritize the current facets of your life that deliver more moments like these to you. Remember, you don’t need to think about the practical side of things yet. Just focus on what truly makes you tick. Doing this will help you connect with what you care about deeply and what you do not. Keep the list short and sweet—no longer than five things. Ask yourself the following questions in order to connect with your priorities:  How would you like to live your life? How would you like to be healthy and vital? How would you like to have deeper connections with people in your life? What will make you proud to be able to say about yourself in ten years time? These obligations might be survival necessities, like paying rent and buying groceries, or they might be things that others expect from you, like time and affection. What are the things that you do in attempts to avoid emotional or physical punishment? What do you do out of care and a sense of responsibility? Recognizing what you do out of fear for the alternative will sharpen your ability to see when you are acting from a priority and when you are acting out of fear, urgency or obligation.  Slowly, you'll learn to make different decisions about what needs to be dealt with and when. Allow yourself to prioritize the things that you do from an internal, joyous sense of responsibility so that you don't get too bogged down to realize if the things that you care about most begin to suffer from neglect. Begin to notice which obligations can be altered, split, or delegated in order for your values and priorities to be upheld. Can an aunt, friend, or coworker help out with the obligation some of the time? Maybe some of these obligations are not really yours to uphold at all. To live without getting overwhelmed or confused about what your priorities are, it is crucial to surround yourself with people who make you feel comfortable enough to be confident and creative. When you are around others, try to be extra mindful of the people who make you feel alive and alert and who makes spending time feel like a chore. This will bring out your gut feelings about whose presence really nourishes you, making it easier to spend your time feeling uplifted rather than drowning in unsatisfying social obligations. Ask yourself questions, like “Do I feel valuable around this person?\" and \"Who makes my contributions seem silly?” The answers might be surprising. Do you drink, smoke, or zone out to the television frequently? Awareness of your vices is important not because you should punish yourself for them, but so that you can understand how you deal with life already.  By becoming aware of the roles your vices play in your life you can learn how to use them responsibly without making them forbidden fruit. Recognize when you turn to them and notice how the frequency of your use ebbs and flows with changing circumstances. For example, if you go out partying to relax, begin to see this as just one of many tools that you use to deal with life. As long as it's not your only one, you will have the control to realize when it's a useful option and when you might want to use another tool, such as meditation or yoga. What are your most important qualities? Understanding the gifts you can offer the world can help you see the things that are worth dealing with and the things that you can leave behind. Take a few hours to think deeply about what makes you special so that you can better orient yourself to your real priorities.  Spend time in a place where you can reflect. Try going to your favorite place in nature, or spending time near people who understand and accept you. When you can really be yourself, what qualities emerge?

For example, if you are an environmental charity, then you might want to buy a hybrid vehicle.  If your audience is young, then you might want something sporty. However, if your audience consists mostly of families, then you can buy a minivan or other family-sized car. You can’t raffle off a car you don’t own. Accordingly, you should identify how you will get a vehicle. You have a few options:  Obtain donations. People can donate to your organization and then you can use the proceeds to buy a car. Approach local corporations, such as large hardware stores, Fortune 500 companies, professional sports teams, and any business that has expressed an interest in your organization. Ask a dealer to donate. Some auto dealers will donate a car, provided you advertise that they are the donor. Buy with your own funds. If your organization has money from prior fundraisers, then you might buy the vehicle outright. You need to approach donors strategically. No one will give you money without understanding the purpose of your organization. Make sure to have the following information available for potential donors to look at:  Your organization’s background: when you were established, how much you have raised, etc. How you will showcase the sponsor. For example, will you mention them on marketing materials? On the raffle ticket itself? How you will monitor and evaluate the raffle. For example, does your organization have an accountant or bookkeeper who will oversee the raffle and keep track of the money raised? How you will use the money raised. Explain how the funds will further your mission. You can increase interest in your raffle if you also offer smaller prizes. This way, more than one person is a “winner” at the raffle. Consider offering these other prizes:  cash awards vacation getaways electronics items (laptop, flat screen TV, radio, etc.) gift certificates Some government authorities have strict rules regulating raffles. Accordingly, you should consult with an attorney in your area to discuss whether or not you can hold the raffle. You can find an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.  Many U.S. states limit raffles to non-profit charitable organizations, churches, or volunteer organizations. States may also require organizations to have been in existence for a certain number of years before they can hold a raffle. Check whether you need to pay taxes on the vehicle and whether you need to register it before the raffle. The lawyer can also help you register your raffle, which is required in some states. For example, in California, you must register your raffle with the state’s Attorney General. Once you have met with an attorney, you can better assess whether you want to go ahead with the raffle. Consider the time and money involved and decide whether to pursue a different fundraiser.  There’s always a chance you won’t sell enough tickets to cover the cost of the car. For this reason, think carefully before buying the car outright with your funds. If you can’t get a dealer to donate a car, then you might want to scrap the raffle. As an alternative, you can hold a raffle for smaller items, such as vacations or cash prizes.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Decide what kind of car to raffle.

Writing out a single thesis statement? Coming up with some possible main ideas? That sounds a lot more doable. If you tend to procrastinate, try making shorter to-do lists that will make your job easier.  Break up larger tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks to make your work sound a lot easier, even though you're doing the same thing. Break it up by how difficult the tasks are, or how much time you think you'll need to spend on each.  Prioritize the most important things first, or the most timely tasks. You've got to come up with a topic before you start doing research. So come up with your topics and try for a thesis statement before you start poking around online doing research. Some recent studies show that we often procrastinate because we use up all the time we have allotted to complete something. In other words, if you've got three months to write a paper, most people will take three months to write that paper, even if that means writing it all in the last five hours before it is due.  Give yourself a specific page count, word count, or other deadline for the next hour or two. If you're working on the Internet, make yourself finish before your app kicks it and turns it off for an hour. You can use Freedom or Stop Procrastinating to set productivity goals for yourself, as well as managing your deadlines on your own. Productivity studies regularly reveal that taking short breaks every hour or so helps long-term productivity more than taking a single long break. Don't work for longer than an hour at a time. If you want, take five minutes to cue up a short YouTube video or mess around on Facebook. Take a break no longer than 5-7 minutes, each hour.  Supposedly, working 52 minutes is the ideal amount of time for you to work before taking a break. Give yourself a break to rest your mind and be at your best. Schedule breaks to help remind yourself. Set a phone alarm, or use your web blocker setting to go off every 52 minutes to give yourself some time. When the net cuts back out, get back to work. Tab browsing and high speed Internet can quickly become overwhelming. If your browser window involves shopping, researching, writing, chatting, and designing a .gif at the same time, then narrow your focus. Make it your goal to only have one window and one tab open at a time. Finish what you're doing before you open something else. Tab browsing can cut into your attention span and the length of time you stay on an individual page. If you need to be researching on the Internet, slow down and look through your resources more thoroughly instead of tabbing out. Don't try to carry on a conversation with your friend in a G-Chat while you're also trying to write an e-mail. Don't try to read up on the topic for your history paper while you're live-tweeting the Academy Awards. Do one thing at a time when you're on the Internet, and the quality of what you're doing will be higher. Some studies show that instrumental music can improve productivity, specifically on repetitive tasks. That means that it might not be great for writing, or doing other Internet-related activities, but if you're doing something repetitive online, it can be a great booster to your attention span and ability to work. Keep the volume low and the mood relatively subdued. Listening to really fast-paced math rock probably isn't the best way to work. Support yourself as you work. Give yourself little rewards for periods of productivity. Use rewards that will keep you productive, instead of making you procrastinate. For example, instead of pulling up a YouTube video, get outside and go for a quick walk. Instead of goofing on Facebook, make a cup of green tea, which has brain-boosting properties that will help you stay focused. WOOP stands for Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan. Set a goal, visualising the obstacles, then chart the way ahead. Research suggests that this method is very effective in working past potential obstacles. Help yourself deal with procrastination.   Plan some time before you start a task that'll be online. Plot out the potential for you to procrastinate and make mistakes. Visualize doing the task properly and correctly. See yourself not pulling up that Podcast and wasting time. Do it the right way.

Some of us learn with our hands, some of us with our eyes, and some of us with our ears (and others a combination). If you can't remember a  thing your professor said, maybe you're just going about it the wrong way.  Once you find out your learning style, you can zone in on what's best for you. Do you remember best the things you've seen? Then study those notes and make graphs! The things you've heard? Go to class and record those lectures. Things you do with your hands? Turn the concepts into something you can build. As much as it is boring and monotonous, it is incredibly useful -- sometimes professors don't even mention the info in class! After reading a paragraph, revise it in your head without looking. Then read it again. It will stay in your mind for a longer time. It is particularly effective when you have less time for studying.  Often the things mentioned in class that are also mentioned in the book are the most important. If you run across some of this while reading, highlight it. You'll want to know where it is to find it later. Don't write off the benefits of scanning. Concentrating on the main ideas (the highlighted text, italics, etc.) will get your mind going. If you can fill in the blanks, great! If you can't, read deeper. For most courses in middle school, high school, and junior/community college, most of what is on the tests and homework will be discussed in the class. If your teacher draws a diagram on the board, copy that down - it can help you remember the information.  Write good, legible notes. Use highlighters if there's something you need to find easily flipping through your notes, but don't highlight too much text or it defeats the purpose. Colored pens are fun to write with if you want to get more creative with your notes, but use them only for sections of your notes that you feel will be on a test or are important. . Wasting nights pouring over books and emerging feeling like you've gotten nothing out of it is just about the worst. Instead of falling asleep over your textbook, try the following:  Make a study guide and review it. Look in the textbook and put all important ideas and details in your notes. Go over it until you feel like you know the material well. If you've written it, you'll probably remember more of it. Make someone test you on the study guide. Talking about the information out loud is a lot easier to retain than going over the same stuff in your brain over and over. When you have to explain it to someone else, it forces you to understand it, not just know it. Invent fun ways to study. Make flash cards, have a friend over, or join an after-school homework club if you can for help from a teacher or friend from the same class. You can make a board game to make studying fun and easy, or you can just type up your notes if it makes it easier to read. Do as much as possible to make sure you know the material. You've done your homework, so you're totally prepared to participate in class. Show that you know your stuff! There are a few reasons this is a good idea. The most important one is that participating in class will cement in your head the stuff you learned from doing your homework (before it was more like Jell-O).  The second good reason is that it will cement the information in your brain. Seriously. Talking about it out loud (especially in class, where it's a bit more stressful than when with a friend) uses a different part of your brain than just writing about it. This way, you're covering all your bases. The third good reason is that your professor will totally appreciate it. No teacher likes a room full of crickets. Get on their good side, and you'll get treated better when grade time comes around or when you ask for extra credit. If you're not sure what's required for a good grade or are struggling with the coursework, ask your teacher for help. It doesn't have to be a complex question; your teacher is always happy to help you. Ask after class, during office hours, or in an e-mail for assistance. Often things we're told one-on-one stick with us more than things we're just being lectured about. In addition to the personalized learning session, your teacher will appreciate your efforts and straight up probably like you more. Having a teacher that likes you can come in very, very, very handy. If in the end the subject is super hard, and you just can't understand it, get a tutor to help you. Sometimes a tutor is even more helpful than getting a one-on-one with a teacher because they are closer to your age and can explain things to you in a manner that you can understand better.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Know your learning style Read the textbook.

Don’t feel worried, anxious, or embarrassed as your parents are meant to be there for you always. They may also know more than you think. With proper planning and communication, you will be able to have the conversation that you’re looking for. Your parents get worried because they care about you and want the best for you. With that in mind, they will be happy that you are seeking their advice for a problem. Any problems or awkwardness won’t simply go away if you avoid having a conversation with your parents. Relieve the stress by getting it out in the open. Knowing that your parents are trying to understand you and solve any problems can help alleviate your stress and anxiety. Do you want to talk to both your parents or is it something mom is better suited to handle? Your relationship with each parent is going to be different so ask yourself what will be the most appropriate course of action.  Some topics might be easier to discuss with one parent over the other, one parent might be calmer while the other is quicker to anger. In this case, it may be best to talk to your calmer parent first and then talk to the other parent together. Know that your parents are most likely going to tell each other about a conversation you have no matter if you only tell one of them. It’s best to include both in your conversation but smart to enlist the help of one to talk to the other if you feel that’s the best course of action. For example, you don’t want to alienate your dad by only telling your mom about a school bully. Ask your mom if you can talk to your dad together because you’re scared he will get angry at you for not standing up and fighting. Find out your parents’ schedule so you know when a good time to chat will be. You don’t want your parents to be distracted thinking about a meeting or having to prepare dinner. The location of your conversation is also important as you may not want any distractions like TV or your parents’ coworkers chiming in. While you may know what you want out of the conversation, there could be several different answers your parents give you. Plan for everything. Ideally, you want the conversation to go your way but it’s okay if it doesn’t. You are never alone as there are numerous resources including teachers and other responsible adults. If the outcome is not what you desired, you can try several things:  Talk to your parents again. Perhaps you caught them at a bad time. If they are already having a bad day they might not be in the best frame of mind to discuss your situation with an open mind. For example, don’t ask them if you can go to the school dance after you just made them late for your sister’s dance recital. Drop it. There’s no sense in infuriating your parents and ruining your chance at getting what you want anytime in the near future. If you have had a respectful and open conversation and both sides have pleaded their case, accept that your parent’s point of view. Showing them that you are mature enough to respect their perspective will help your case in the future as they will be more receptive to what you have to say knowing that you are able to keep your emotions in check. Seek outside support. Enlist the help of your grandparents, your friends' parents, or teachers to help plead your case. Your parents will always be protective of you so asking outside support can convince them that you can handle a situation. For example, you can ask an older sibling tell your parents that they have been to the area that you want to go to and can escort you to the location to make sure it's safe.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Be brave.

Find a Thai language learning book in order to learn the alphabet, or go online and look at any website with the Thai alphabet listed.  For example, at the website called Omniglot, you can find an alphabet and written pronunciations for English speakers.  Find an app with phrases and their pronunciations, or look for a website you can visit frequently to help you get the pronunciations right. One app that may help is called “In 24 Hours Learn to Speak Thai.”  Go online and look at your local library website to see if they have lessons on Thai that you can check out. These may be books, manuals, DVDs, or CD-ROM programs that you can watch or play on your computer. You can also buy Thai learning programs offline from websites like Amazon and Ebay. Thai is a tonal language, so learning the alphabet does no good until you have learned to pronounce each word carefully. Make sure that any learning programs you get have a verbal feature so that you can hear the words. One website that might help is thai-language.com. It shows you both the Thai script and English letter versions of Thai words, as well as what they should sound like. Whether you are inside Thailand or not, you can learn to speak Thai by exposing yourself to those who speak this language. This is called immersion. Find a native Thai speaker either by making friend with locals if you are located in Thailand, or finding a Thai community in your city. Make friends with a Thai speaker and integrate them into your life so that you are forced to speak Thai on a regular basis.  The reason you need to practice speaking in a language to learn it, which is what immersion does, is because your brain will process language more like a native speaker.  If you aren’t living in Thailand, it will be more difficult to be “immersed,” but finding a native speaker to converse with on a regular basis will help more than silently studying the language. If you don’t know anyone from Thailand in your city, visit places where you may meet a Thai person, such as at a college, a market, a local restaurant, a church, or classes at a community center. You can also try to find Thai speakers you can video chat with online. You may find Thai speakers in Facebook groups, or ask people you know on social media if they have any Thai friends who might be willing to Skype with you. Although to become a Thai speaker you do need to speak it, studying the basics of the language will help you understand what you are saying, which can help you remember how to speak Thai. This may help you learn to speak Thai faster.  Look at the grammar structure. Ask yourself, where do adjectives and verbs occur in a sentence? For example, in Spanish, the adjective usually comes after the noun, whereas in English, the adjective usually comes before. In Thai, the verb structure is simpler than European languages, but its tones and sounds are extremely important. How you say a word can change the meaning. While you are studying Thai, you should be speaking it on a regular basis. While it’s important to understand the verb structure, it is more important to learn conversational basics in order to speak Thai. The complete grasp of grammar will come as you speak it. Make daily, bi-weekly, or weekly appointments with your Thai friend so that you don’t get behind in practice. As you learn Thai, look up words that you don’t know. When you hear a person speaking Thai using words you have never heard before, either write them down or remember them so that you can look them up.  Since simple sentences in Thai can be easier than the same sentences in English and Romance languages, start with simple greetings like “hello” (sa-wat-dee) and “how are you” (sa-baai dee mai).  Focus on getting your pronunciations of new words correct. Ask your friends who speak Thai to help you. In order to help you get the pronunciations right, listen to music in Thai or watch Thai speakers on TV and in internet videos. Hearing others speaking this language every day is important for you to speak Thai, and if you aren’t in a community of Thai speakers all day long, substitute this with TV, internet videos, and music. If you write in Thai, this may also help you understand the language so that you can speak it with more accuracy. Whether not you are an expert Thai speaker, taking a trip to Thailand is an important part of learning to speak Thai. In Thailand, you will be inundated with the Thai language. You will see it on every billboard and poster, on every storefront and newspaper, and Thai is all you will likely hear.  Costs once you are inside Thailand are pretty reasonable. There are 35 Thai baht to 1 US dollar, and a high-end hotel costs 3,000B per night (or about $85 USD).  A plane ticket to Bangkok, Thailand, from Los Angeles in the U.S., for example, is about $900 round trip in August. The same ticket from London is about 585GBP ($860 USD).    Try to stay with a Thai family so that you can be exposed to Thai all day.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "One of the most common pieces of advice you may find online when trying to remove dried silicone from your hands is to use acetone. Acetone, an organic chemical frequently used in nail polish removers, is able to dissolve some plastics (like, for instance, acrylic nail polish) with ease. Its ability to dissolve or weaken silicone caulk is less definite. However, many online sources attest to its usefulness. To use this method, soak the corner of a paper towel with pure acetone or a nail polish remover containing acetone and gently wet the spots on your hands covered with acetone. Don't pour the acetone all over your hands — this is wasteful and can produce noxious unpleasant fumes. If using nail polish remover, check the ingredient label to be sure it contains acetone before using. Silicone, like many other synthetic compounds, will eventually weaken if heated up gradually. Because of this property, some sources recommend using a hair dryer to loosen the caulk's hold on your hands. Turn the dryer on and wave it over the affected areas, allowing the silicone to gradually warm. Once you feel that the silicone has heated up, try scrubbing with a sponge or another mild abrasive to get it off. If you want to try this method, be sure to start with the lowest possible setting on the hair dryer. Gradually increase the heat as needed and stop immediately if the heat becomes intense or painful. Silicone isn't worth burning yourself over — it will eventually fall off on its own. Another way to get silicone off of your hands is simply to rub (and rub, and rub...) until there's none left. However, this method requires a warning. Silicone is quite tough — in fact, for most purposes, it's tougher than your skin. Because of this, you'll want to be very careful as you use your abrasive to remove the silicone to avoid rubbing your skin raw. Use only mild abrasives, not harsh ones like steel wool. Stop rubbing well before you think you might be sore. Remember, the silicone will eventually fall off on its own, so there's no reason to hurt yourself trying to get it off. Just a few appropriate abrasives you might consider using are:  Kitchen sponges Fine-grit sandpaper (if you're careful) Pumice stones Like acetone, mineral spirits (a turpentine substitute sometimes called \"white spirits\" in the UK) are sometimes prescribed for the task of weakening stubborn silicone caulk. As with acetone, the actual usefulness of mineral spirits is the subject of some doubt, though some home improvement sites recommend them. If you have some mineral spirits handy, try applying some to dried-on silicone lightly with a soaked paper towel. Follow with abrasion once the spirits have had a chance to weaken the silicone. If you don't have mineral spirits, you can usually find some at major hardware stores for fairly cheap (usually not much more than $10 per gallon). While mineral spirits are usually not dangerous to touch, be sure to thoroughly wash yourself after coming into contact with them. Being in direct contact with mineral spirits for several hours or longer can lead to seriously nasty chemical burns. Sometimes, particularly stubborn spots of silicone caulk can stick to your hands despite your repeated efforts to get it off. In these cases, your best option may be simply to wait for it to fall off on its own, rather than wear your hands red trying to get it off. Your body naturally sheds dead skin cells nearly constantly. Once the skin under the dried-on silicone dies, it will eventually fall off, taking the caulk with it. The human body usually takes about 27 days to completely shed and replenish an entire layer of skin. The silicon gel dried to your hands will probably take less time to fall off (on the order of a week or so). When it comes to getting silicone caulk off of your hands, stick to the safe methods described in this article — don't risk trying anything that may hurt you. For instance, while acetone and mineral spirits are generally safe for brief use on your hands, other, harsher chemicals can present serious problems. Many noxious or caustic solvents can be harmful if touched, inhaled, or ingested, so you'll want to stay far away from them. Below are just a few of the sorts of chemicals you definitely won't want to use to get caulk off of your hands:  Bleach Drain cleaner Paint thinner Lye Strong acids or bases. Never use a sharp tool or a harsh abrasive to physically remove silicone caulk from your hands. Though it may be tempting to use a knife or a handful of steel wool to scrape or cut annoying dried-on caulk away from your hands, these methods run a high risk of injuring your hands. On top of this, there's very little guarantee that they work well against the gummy, clingy texture of silicone. Though this advice probably goes without saying for most, in the interests of safety, it bears mentioning.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Try acetone.

You can also integrate essential oils in your steam clean to help “draw” out the deep pimple. You will need to following supplies:  1-quart pot Water A clean towel Essential oils Dried herbs, if you do not have access to essential oils You should use essential oils that have antibacterial or antiseptic properties and that can help to sooth the deep pimples.  Spearmint or peppermint: Due to a high percentage of menthol, spearmint or peppermint has antiseptic and immune boosting properties.  Thyme: This herb can improve your immune system and is known to be antibacterial. It is also known to increase your blood circulation.  Lavender: This herb has soothing and calming properties. It also has antibacterial properties and can help with anxiety and depression.  Calendula: This herb can help to accelerate healing and also has antimicrobial properties.  Always pre-test the oil on a small area of your skin before you use it. This will confirm you are not allergic to the herbal oil. To test the oil, place one drop on your wrist and wait 10–15 minutes. Only use the oil for steam cleaning if there is no reaction on the surface of your skin. Use a hair tie to put your hair back so your face is exposed. Then, wash your face with a plant-oil based product. This will ensure it is clean and ready for steaming. Use oils like glycerin, grapeseed, and sunflower to create a plant-oil based product.  Use your fingertips to apply the product to your face, gently massaging in circular motions. Wash your face for about a minute and then use lukewarm water to rinse your face, removing the cleanser. Pat your face dry with a clean towel. Use the 1-quart pot and fill it halfway with water. Place it on the stove and let it boil for one to two minutes. Make sure the water creates a nice flow of steam.  Add one to two drops of the essential oils. Use dried herbs if you do not have access to herbal oils. Use ½ teaspoon of dried herbs per quart of water. Allow the water to boil for another minute and then take it off the heat. Be careful, as the pot will be hot. Shut off the stove and put the pot on an even surface in an open area. Cover your head with the towel first so you can position your face 12–15 inches from the water. Doing this will cause your blood vessels to dilate and your pores to open up without damaging your skin with the steam. Close your eyes and breathe in and out deeply. Relax and be calm as the steam wafts over your face. One minute in, remove your face from the steam and let your skin rest for 10 minutes. Only reheat the water and steam again if you do not have an allergic reaction to the oils in the steam after 10 minutes, with no sneezing or itching. Hold your face over the steam for up to 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, remove your face from the steam and rinse your skin with lukewarm water. Pat dry it with a towel. End the steam session by hydrating your face with natural oils or a non-comedogenic moisturizer. This will keep your skin soft and prevent damage to your skin.  Go for store-brand moisturizers that are labeled non-comedogenic or non-clogging, like Olay, Neutrogena, and Clinique moisturizers. For a natural option, go for natural oils that are high in non-comedogenic properties, such as hemp seed oil, shea butter, sunflower oil, castor oil, calendula oil, or argan oil.

If you want to develop the distance of your jumps, you need to work on your speed. Practice wind-sprints, long distance running, and working on your short bursts of speed. Good long jumpers are fast runners. If you're going to work on your long jump, you'll leap off your dominant foot, the foot you feel most comfortable leaping from or kicking with. Usually, this will be the same foot on the side that you write with, but not necessarily. If you're not sure, take a soccer ball outside and kick it around a few times. Which side feels more comfortable? That's probably your dominant foot, and it'll be your plant foot for long jumps. Long-jumping is usually done in a sand pit, and careful technique is necessary to avoid injury. Never attempt long-jumping using this form on the ground. If you don't have access to a long-jump pit, you need to practice doing hops and landing on your feet. This is a great way of building up your distance and getting better long jumps later. It won't be time wasted working out. The take-off line should be clearly marked, beyond which will be the landing zone, where your jump will be marked. When you're long-jumping, it's important to take off as close to the line as possible to get the most out of your jump, but not to cross it, or your jump won't count. Watch the line closely, and plant your plant foot just on the right side of it. Accelerate and continue powering to the take-off line. You need to be going as fast as possible when you reach the end of the running strip. It's your momentum that should carry you into the jump, less than your strength. Plant your dominant foot on the right side of the line and focus on jumping as far forward as possible, thrusting your hips forward as much as possible. Let your momentum carry you up and over the line and into the landing pit as far as possible. Thrust your hips forward to carry you as far as possible. As you feel the apex of your leap begin to pass and you feel yourself starting to come down, thrust your feet and your arms forward to prepare for the landing and to give yourself a few extra inches on your leap. The jump will be measured at the farthest point you touch from the take-off line, so sticking your feet out far in front of you is important. The landing isn't nearly as graceful as the take-off in a good long-jump. Your landing should be mostly dictated from proper take-off form, but you can keep yourself safe by keeping your knees flexed slightly, your ankles very straight, and not using your wrists to brace your fall. Let the sand do the work for you.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Practice your sprints. Find your dominant foot.

This pain may be felt on either side, but tends to occur more on the left. The pain may be persistent for several days, or it may come and go. Abdominal pain is usually accompanied by abdominal tenderness. This may be noticeable when someone or something touches your abdomen, when you sneeze, or when you stretch. Both constipation and diarrhea can be signs of diverticulitis. Diverticulitis causes constipation because food cannot pass easily through your bowels, and the bowel walls become constricted. Diarrhea is usually a result of overflow from the resulting constipation. Constipation is more common, but if you experience either of these symptoms in conjunction with lower abdominal pain, you should make an appointment with your health care provider. Diverticulitis can also impact how frequently you have a bowel movement, as well as how big the movement is. If you notice substantial changes in your bowel frequency or volume, this could be another symptom of diverticulitis. Vomiting is a common symptom of diverticulitis. If you are experiencing unexplained nausea and vomiting, especially in conjunction with severe and persistent abdominal cramps or pain, get medical attention right away. In some cases, diverticulitis may cause a fever along with other symptoms. Fevers associated with diverticulitis may also come with nausea, vomiting, or other flu-like symptoms. If you have both abdominal pain or tenderness and a fever, make an appointment with your doctor to screen for diverticulitis.  A fever is a relatively uncommon symptom of diverticulitis. Abdominal pain, cramping, and vomiting are the most typical symptoms. Any temperature over 98.6 °F (37.0 °C) is considered a fever, but fevers generally aren’t considered severe unless they are over 100.4 °F (38.0 °C).

Common genetic diseases for the breed include degenerative myelopathy, megaesophagus, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  If you're getting your puppy from a breeder, they should know about the history of disease in the puppy's lineage. Discuss the likelihood of these diseases developing in your own puppy. You want to see the puppy on multiple occasions, if possible, so you can get a better sense of its overall temperament and health. Just like people, puppies can have their good days and their bad days, so you don't want to make a decision based on a single interactions. Take your time and look closely at each puppy you're thinking of adopting. Puppies should be the appropriate weight — not too chubby, but not too thin — and odor free. They should have clear eyes (not runny or red) and clean ears. The coat should be full and glossy (no balding spots), and free of mats or fecal matter. Look for signs of excessive scratching, which may point to skin or coat problems. It should have a healthy appetite, and no signs of vomiting or diarrhea. Also assess the puppy's social health. Puppies should be curious and well-socialized, playful and friendly. Temperament testing a dog or puppy helps you choose a dog that fits your family and lifestyle. For example, a high-energy puppy may be the right fit for an active outdoor family, but wrong for a family who likes to relax indoors. For temperament testing, separate the puppy from the litter to make sure it's focusing its attention on you.  Walk around to see if the puppy follows you. A puppy that follows humans is well-socialized to them and enjoys their company. Kneel and call the puppy to you. It should show interest in you and come when called. Lift the puppy in the air to see how well it deals with being carried. Gently restrain the puppy with its belly up. Though a little bit of struggle is okay, you don't want a puppy who fights you when you try to handle it. Look for a puppy that isn't afraid —note if his tail is between his legs. In all interactions, look for signs of fear or mistrust. These puppies may not adjust well to your home. If you see a puppy who guards its food or toys, think twice about adopting it. While these behaviors can be improved through training, it's an extra obstacle you don't have to face if you choose a dog with a better temperament. Look for behaviors like growling or snapping when people or other dogs approach their food or toys. A dog who runs away may also have problems interacting safely and comfortably in a home.  If you decide to take on a “project” with behavioral concerns, make sure you have a behaviorist or trainer you trust lined up first. Beware that having a \"reactive\" dog will add to the potential liability of ownership. You want a puppy that's playful and not fearful because many dogs bite out of fear. German Shepherds are large, powerful animals as adults, so you absolutely cannot start out with a puppy who's fearful by nature. Puppies born with a fearful personality may be harder to train, and may display fear aggression as adults. You may visit a litter and fall in love with a puppy a few states away. If you cannot take the dog home immediately (for example, if it's too young to be weaned), you need to arrange for its transportation at a later date. For the puppy's health, you should make the trip to pick it up yourself. Shipping puppies is very stressful on them, and often results in a sick puppy when you pick them up from the airport.

Keep in mind that once you receive your tiles, you won’t be able to change your bet. When you’re first starting out, you may want to bet low until you get the hang of how to play. The dealer should give themselves 4 tiles as well. You can look at your tiles at this point, but be careful you don’t show them to any of the other players. Once you’re dealt your tiles, you’ll need to split them up into 2 “hands.” Each hand will have 2 tiles in it. The goal is to create the most valuable hands possible with the tiles you’ve been dealt. Your most valuable hand will be known as your high hand, and your other hand will be called your low hand.  If you have 2 tiles that make a pair, it’s a good idea to put them together to make a hand since pairs are the most valuable hands. If you don’t have any pairs, you want to divide up your tiles so that the tiles in each hand add up to the highest value possible. Everyone should turn up their tiles at the same time. Double check that everyone is finished dividing up their tiles before you flip your tiles over. Differentiate between your 2 hands by positioning one vertically and one horizontally. In order to beat the dealer, you want your hands, or tiles, to be more valuable than their hands. First, compare your high hand to the dealer’s high hand. Then, compare your low hand to the dealer’s low hand. If both your high hand and low hand beats their high hand and low hand, you win the bet!  If your high hand beats the dealer’s high hand but your low hand doesn’t, or vice versa, you don’t win the bet. You need to beat both of the dealer’s hands. Every player should compare their high and low hands to the dealer’s hands. Players shouldn’t compare their hands with anyone but the dealer. If the value of your hands is tied with the dealer’s hands, the dealer wins. For example, if the dealer has a pair of Gee Joon (their high hand) and a non-pair of Yun and Day (which adds up to 0 and is their low hand) and you have a pair of Teen (your high hand) and a pair of Ping (your low hand), you wouldn't beat the dealer because, even though your low hand beats their low hand, the dealer's high hand beats your high hand. But, if you were to have a pair of Mooy (your high hand) and a pair of Look (your low hand) and the dealer has a non-pair of Bon and Gor (which adds up to 8 and is their high hand) and a non-pair of Bon and Foo (which adds up to 5 and is there low hand), you would win because both your high hand and low hand beat the dealer's high and low hands. At the end of the each round, you’ll need to determine whether you or the dealer owes money. Whether you collect, push, or pay will depend on if you won or lost the bet.  Collect: If you won the bet by beating both of the dealer’s hands, collect your payment from the dealer. The dealer should give you twice as much as you bet at the beginning of the round. Push: If you beat one of the dealer’s hands but not the other, you push and don’t collect or pay any money. Instead, you can hold onto your bet for the next round. Pay: If both of the dealer’s hands were more valuable than your hands, or if both were tied, pay the dealer all of the money you bet at the beginning of the round. Choose a new dealer if you’d like and then place your bet. Then, have the dealer pass out 4 new tiles to all of the players and start the round.

That depends on you. So don't fear failure and simply consider them as a potential foundation of a new understanding and strength. There is a reason great people failed a lot. Research indicates that individuals who accept their challenges can actually be more motivated toward positive change. Additionally, individuals who affirm or validate themselves often are more able to think about and understand their challenges.  Recognize your strengths and your challenges, even if you have to list all of them down. Understand yourself as an outside observer. Try to objectively look at yourself by observing your behaviors such as how you act, speak, and think around other people. Assess yourself and what you do regularly. Allocate a time for this at the weekends. Some do that before going to bed every night.

Try to take away these foods and liquids from your diet so that your esophagus can heal.  There are other dietary restrictions as well. Dairy products, such as whole milk, cheese, butter, and sour cream, are also to be avoided. Also avoid food containing peppermint or spearmint. There are also fruits you should avoid as well, such as oranges, lemons, lime, grapefruit, and pineapples. If you do find yourself consuming these foods, drink plenty of water and eat approved foods to dilute their acidic powers. Create five to seven divided meals a day and avoid eating two to three hours before bedtime. The esophageal sphincter of the stomach relaxes when the stomach gets too full, bringing the hydrochloric acid up into the esophageal walls. In other words, if you eat too much, your esophagus will let you know. It's best to avoid it by eating smaller meals more often. Most of us frequently have this issue out at restaurants. At home it isn't so bad, but at restaurants it's just so tempting to finish what's in front of you, which is often too much. To avoid the impending disaster, box up half of your meal at the very beginning. You can take it home to eat later later. There are a few foods you should be eating every day to combat acid reflux. These include:   Oatmeal. Oatmeal makes you feel full without causing reflux. It also absorbs the acid in fruits if you add a small amount. This will considerably aid in lowering the acidity in the stomach.  Ginger. Ginger contains anti-inflammatory ingredients to help treat various gastrointestinal problems. Peel or slice ginger roots and add it to your favorite recipes.  Green vegetables. Green leafy vegetable contain low calories and zero saturated fat. It’s the most recommended diet for patients suffering from acid reflux. Just be sure to stay away from using tomatoes, onions, cheese, and high-fat salad dressing. Try asparagus, cauliflower, parsley, and other green vegetables.  White meat. Red meats such as steak and beef are hard to digest, so go for chicken and turkey meats instead. Chicken makes good soup, too. The chicken skin contains a high amount of fat, though, so remove it before cooking. Poultry meats can be boiled or grilled; avoid eating them fried.  Seafood. Just like poultry, fish, shrimp, and other seafood also help avoid acid reflux. Just don’t fry them. Seafood is easily digested and is very low in fat and therefore helps prevent reflux and avoid heartburn. You should be drinking  eight to 12 glasses of water every day to prevent dehydration. It will help dilute the acid contents found in your stomach and gut, making it less acidic. And your hair, skin, nails, and organs will benefit, too. . Obesity and excess weight are among the major risk factors of having acid reflux. Start an exercise program that focuses on simple exercises that can help burn calories and start eating healthier. A thirty minute walk in the park can burn up to 100 calories. Dieting doesn't mean you have to starve yourself. Try to exercise more, eat smaller amounts per day, and eat more low caloric food that are better for you. You don't have to go hungry.  Having an active lifestyle can fight off heart disease, diabetes, and a number of other health issues as well. Focus on leisure activities like dancing, horseback rides, or golf. It’s fun to burn calories while doing what you love. Then, slowly increase your physical activity as you get stronger. Determine your body mass index and start losing weight. The normal body mass index (BMI) range from 18.5 to 24.9. This will help you determine if your weight is currently on the normal range. You can manually calculate your BMI by dividing your body weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared, or you could use an online guide or calculator.  Count your daily required calories and track the food that you eat. A total of 3500 calories is equivalent to 1 pound. So if you plan to lose 1 pound per week, you need to cut 500 calories from your daily required caloric intake. and avoid alcohol. Smoking irritates the esophageal lining which causes more inflammation and pain. If you can’t stop smoking you should gradually decrease the amount you smoke per day. If your overall health wasn't reason enough, do it to make the everyday acid-reflux free. Drinking beer and other carbonated beverages can also cause harm to the linings of the esophagus and stomach. It is best to have total abstinence from smoking and drinking. You should elevate the head of your bed using pillows by about six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm). Improvement of symptoms can be resolved when the upper body is elevated. It will prevent reflux of acid or any gastric contents while sleeping. While you're at it, get enough sleep, too. Having enough rest and enough hours of sleep will allow your body to relax, repair, and build up damaged tissues and muscles in the body. Muscle and tissue repairs happen when the body is at rest or in a sleeping state.

Therefore, experiment with new bands, new albums, or even new genres of music.  You should also look around for local concerts. Even small towns generally have a handful of local bands. While they might not always be of the highest caliber, they might be interesting in their own way. Try an online radio program. Relinquishing control over your queue means that you might happen across some songs you otherwise wouldn’t listen to. Alternatively, ask friends if they have heard any good new music. Things that require your brain to be active and attentive will help cure boredom. Creative pursuits can also help you cultivate skills that will, in the long run, get you out of your boring town. They can make you interesting within your community and help you build a circle of other creative people. Try to learn an instrument or sing. Once you have some experience, find other musicians/singers to put together a band. When you start playing shows, you’ll have an opportunity to meet a lot of new people. If you were in band, choir, or orchestra in high school or college, you can still be part of the same groups in the community.  Many small towns have community bands, orchestras, or choirs that you can take part of. You can always learn a new instrument or sing, and join these groups as well. Some schools have local poetry clubs; if not, you can help put one together. Try to publish a journal with short stories and poetry. Many small towns will also have a community of people interested in visual arts, like painting and drawing. You can try to display your work at cafes or take courses at the local community college. Once upon a time, reading was the only reliable distraction people could turn to. It is still one of the best ways to banish boredom. It requires that you dedicate attention to what you’re doing. You will meet interesting characters, get engaged by a story, and learn more about the world outside of your town. To engage with the book more thoroughly, consider writing as you read. Underline important passages, write in the margins. Evidence suggests that, even if daydreaming seems to give you something to do, it actually only makes boredom worse. When our minds drift to exotic places, our current environment seem even less interesting that it would otherwise. Instead of allowing your mind to drift off into fantasy, try to practice \"mindfulness.\" Mindfulness means focusing intensely on the world around you. Be conscious of your breathing. Listen for sounds, pay attention smells. Try to notice things you otherwise wouldn't. Mindfulness has been shown to improve your mood and your cognitive abilities. Doing new things is one of the best ways to eliminate boredom. In fact, doing something you don’t enjoy, but aren’t accustomed to, is a better way of alleviating boredom than doing something you enjoy, but are used to.   Given the choice between eating candy and shocking themselves, bored people have been shown to prefer electrocution. Regardless of whether the sensation is good or bad, something novel is the best cure for boredom. It can be hard to come up with a new pastime. That is why the first step is often surrounding yourself with people who are interesting and have diverse tastes. They can help expose you to new things you wouldn’t pursue otherwise. Try a new type of food that might seem exotic or scary. Go skiing or skydiving. Watch a movie from a genre you would generally avoid. Go to a concert. Often there are plenty of opportunities to experiment with new things, but our fears prevent us from pursuing them. Meditation might not seem like the most exciting activity, but it does pass the time. Evidence also demonstrates that it increases concentration, which can make it easier to focus on interesting distractions. To really improve your focus, try to dedicate 20 minutes daily to mediation. Meditation means focusing on only one thing for an extended period of time. Take a mantra (a phrase) or an image and focus on it. Clear you mind of everything else. When something else enters you mind, gently brush it aside. Travel can spice up your life and expose you to new things. You might even find when you come back that there were somethings that you missed while away. If you don't have the resources for an international trip, try taking a trip nearby.  If you don't have the resources to jump on a plane, go somewhere nearby. You can drive, take a bus, or ride on a train for a reasonable price. Pick a nearby city, a small town you have never been too, or a scenic, outdoor location. Housing on a vacation might seem expensive, but that is not necessarily the case. Most cities have hostels and, if you are willing to share a room with others, you will probably only need to pay $20-$35 a night.. There are also now websites that allow you to rent space in a local's home, typically for less money than you would spend on a hotel. You can also get involved with a local club. Often, clubs and sports organizations will travel. Typically, this sort of group travel is reasonably priced. A busy vacation, with a lot of sights and destinations, is a good way to alleviate boredom, however, it can also be a bit overwhelming. One good way to enjoy a busy vacation is to plan it with a purpose. Come up with a goal that makes all of your experiences connected, like checking out all the local blues bars or seeing all the paintings of a particular artist. You can even try to write a story based on your traveling experience.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Listen to new music.

When you pull up weeds, be sure that you dig deep enough to remove the entire root system, as pulling out the surface sprouts will not effectively kill the weed. If you must use chemical herbicides on your weeds, use spot applications instead of a broad, whole-yard application. Spraying the entire yard can harm many of the organisms that live in the soil and could potentially pollute your local groundwater system. While it may seem to the untrained eye that grass is simply grass, there are, in fact, many different types of grass. Each variety has its own advantages, depending on the climate and region in which you live.  Perennial Ryegrass is somewhat drought tolerant, easy to establish across the lawn, and can compete well with weeds that sprout up in the yard.  Tall Fescue grass is very drought tolerant and has the deepest root system of all turf grasses, running anywhere from three to six feet deep. Tall Fescue doesn't necessarily use less water, but it does use water the same way a deep-root plant would use water. It also stays green during drought, which is advantageous if you live in a drought-prone climate.  Fine Fescue grass has a low fertilizer requirement and a high drought tolerance. It can actually go dormant during dry periods when water is absent, and will quickly come back to a healthy shade of green once water is returns.  Bentgrass grows well during cool weather, and much like Fine Fescue it can also go dormant during droughts. Bentgrass does not require very much fertilizer, either.  Kentucky Bluegrass grows best in cool, humid, semi-arid, and temperate climates. This grass variety is moderately drought-tolerant. Whether you have a large yard that is difficult to manage or you simply want a little more diversity in your yard's landscape, there are plenty of options for non-turf alternatives. Some drought-stricken communities may even offer incentives to homeowners who opt for non-turf alternatives, so it may be worth checking online or with your local department of natural resources to see if your region offers these incentives.  Ground cover makes a fine substitute for turf in some yards. Ground cover, like drought-resistant plants, are ideal for low-traffic parts of the yard. Planting ground cover in slanted parts of the yard that tend to lose a lot of water may also help conserve some water and promote a greener yard.  Perennials, shrubs, and trees are all excellent alternatives to grass. Many of these plants have drought-resistant varieties that can help control erosion and water loss.  Hardscapes, like decking or pavement (including stepping stones), can help cut back on how much you need to water your yard. Hardscapes also create recreation space, as a deck or patio makes an excellent place to sit outside for picnics, meals, or simple downtime.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Pull weeds frequently.

Let yourself feel grief and allow yourself to work through these stages. Do not try to mask your emotions. If your spouse died suddenly and there were no final requests, explore ideas to honor the memory of your late partner. This may give you a peace of mind, and will ensure that you will not have any mental obstacles in your new life. You can make this a recurring practice, or you may wish to honor your spouse once and then do your best to move on. To honor your spouse you might:  Light a candle in their honor. Take flowers to their grave and talk to them. Let them know what's on your mind. Do an activity that you loved to do together, while remembering everything that was great about your spouse. Your pain will not just disappear, and it will not heal itself. Be patient with yourself as you work through the process of grief.  Grief is a journey that lasts as long as it takes to reconcile all issues pertaining to death, your loved one, yourself, and the good and bad parts of your relationship. Grief and depression can look very similar, but they are quite different. It is important to know the distinction so that if your grief turns to depression, you can seek help from a therapist.  When grieving, you may experience the following: Sadness, despair, mourning, fatigue or low energy, tears, loss of appetite, poor sleep, poor concentration, happy and sad memories, and/or mild feelings of guilt.  If depressed, you may experience symptoms of grief, but also the following: feelings of worthlessness or emptiness, helplessness, extreme guilt, suicidal thoughts, loss of interest in pleasurable activities, extreme fatigue, and/or severe weight loss. Pay attention to how good memories of your spouse make you feel. Do warm memories of your spouse give you some comfort or joy? Or do you feel emptiness and loss that even good memories cannot relieve? If you experience the latter, it may be a sign that you are depressed. What matters is how you feel you are grieving. The loss of your spouse is between you and your spouse. There is no right or wrong answer for the right amount of time to move on.   If someone is telling you that you aren't grieving properly, thank them for their concern and tell them that everyone grieves differently. You may run into someone who thinks that you are either healing \"too fast\" or who thinks you are healing \"too slow\" and have become stuck in your grief. If this happens, be sure to keep in mind that while this person's intentions are probably good and that he or she wants to see you healed, it is up for you to decide when you are ready to move on. There is a time when you need to cry and go through the suffering to get to the other side. There will come a time when you are ready to actively participate in grief work to bring healing to have a new life. Although you had no choice in the loss of your spouse, you can choose how you respond to the situation and how you aim to move on with your life. That said, in the loss of your spouse, you have faced a drastic change. It is best not to make any other drastic changes right away while you are still navigating your loss.

Additionally, if you were required to register your business name with a department of a state or local government, you can obtain a form from the department to discontinue the business name. In dissolving a partnership, make a written memorandum  of the responsibilities of each partner regarding the debts and any future liabilities of the partnership. This is particularly important since normally each partner can be found liable for all the partnership debts. Since you’ll have to notify your creditors of your decision to dissolve the company, it’s a good idea to compile this list in advance of the dissolution. Be sure to keep it updated until the dissolution is complete. That way, you’ll lower the risk of missing a creditor when formal notice has to be given. Your list should include:  lenders insurers suppliers vendors, and service providers. You should try to have this documentation handy in case it’s needed to prove  tax compliance or bill payments during the dissolution process.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Check your organizational documents for dissolution requirements.

Women’s shoes are designed for smaller feet and a narrow stride. Petite women in particular will benefit from women’s shoes. The first thing you will notice is the frame, the basic structure of the snowshoe. There are a few types of common frames in use, and the best one for you will depend on the type of terrain you expect to encounter.  Tubular. This is the more traditional design. It won’t offer as much traction, and is better for softer surfaces like the kind seen in recreational snowshoes, or in deep powder. Flat stock. A newer frame, this is a sturdier design that offers greater traction on steeper or icier surfaces. Plastic decking. Very lightweight frames, usually made from plastic rather than aluminum or other types of metal. These are a little smaller, so they can help save space on a backcountry hut trip. They are best used when flotation is less important. Grip is provided by crampons, the teeth underneath the shoe that provide traction. When you are looking at shoes, flip them over to see where the grips are. Most will have two prongs at the toe. Backcountry snowshoes will also include a row of teeth under the heel that gives better traction doing downhill. If you want greater flexibility to either move off-trail and into deeper snow, or are carrying more weight than usual, you may want to purchase an add-on tail to provide extra length. This gives better weight distribution and better flotation. The way your shoes bind to your feet is probably the most important decision you will make when choosing snowshoes. All snowshoe straps cross over the top of your foot and behind your heel. The heel should be free to move up and down to help you walk. When you choose the bindings, you need to look for the type of material used on the straps and the number of straps on the shoes.  The most common type of straps are rubber, which won’t stretch as much in cold or wet weather. Beginner shoes will have nylon straps, which are more lightweight and easily adjustable. You can’t switch out strap types, so choose wisely.  The number of straps on your shoes will depend on a variety of factors including the size, type of strap, purpose, and manufacturer. In general, the more straps on your shoes, the greater range of adjustability and support you have. When you strap in, check for any pressure points against your feet. There should not be any pressure or tightness. This isn’t something you can break in, and will probably get worse as you continue to use the shoes. If you feel tightness, look for different bindings. When you try on snowshoes, you’ll want to make sure they fit properly. If possible, try them out on snow. If you are at the store, ask if they have a good place for you to try them on. Dirt or hard surfaces may damage the crampons, so be careful.  Open all the buckles and loosen all the adjustment points on the bindings. Make sure there are no obstructions like snow, dirt, or other debris between your foot and the binding bed. Attach the binding straps. Start with the front strap, over your toes, then do the one around your heel. After those two are done, holding your foot in place, attach the remaining straps. Check the tightness of the straps by lifting your foot and taking a few steps. The bindings should be secure, but still allow some freedom of movement. Check for any gaps between the bindings and your boots. You want the straps done as tightly to your boots as possible to prevent snow and other debris from getting in. This can lead to wet boots, or create pressure points. Some will feel better than others and you won't know this until you test a range of them. Walk around in the snowshoes with your boots and socks on to see how they feel on you. You will probably need other gear to go along with your shoes, especially snowshoeing poles to help you walk, and a snowshoe bag for carrying the shoes or other gear. Many retailers will off these items with the shoes as a package deal. This can be useful for a beginner. If you are a more experienced hiker looking for a backcountry experience, you’ll probably need specialized equipment that can handle difficult terrain.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Look for gender-specific models.

Then, strain the rice through a strainer, rinsing it with clean water as you do so.  Some rice is very starchy, and rinsing it before cooking can help to remove the starchy coating on the outside of the rice. It’s not always necessary to soak or rinse rice, but it can be important for rice dishes where you don’t want the grains sticking together. For Chinese-style fried rice, the rice is always boiled before it’s fried. To cook the rice, place it into a medium saucepan. Add a pinch of salt and the water, put the lid on, and bring it to a boil over medium heat.  When it comes to a boil, turn the heat down to a low simmer and continue cooking the rice for about 15 minutes. The rice is ready when all the water has been absorbed and the rice is soft.  Remove the rice from the heat and leave it to sit for at least five minutes, with the lid on. When the rice has had a few minutes to rest after cooking, pour it out onto a cookie sheet greased with a thin layer of oil. Spread the rice out as thin as possible and set it aside to cool. Give the rice 15 to 30 minutes to cool. When the rice is cool enough to handle, put a bit of oil on your fingers to prevent sticking. Use your fingers to break apart the grains and remove any clusters or clumps of rice. In a wok or large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook them for about 10 minutes, until they become a light golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon to remove the onions. Place them in a bowl and set them aside. Some of the best oils for fried rice are canola, peanut, vegetable, and coconut. Add another ½ tablespoon (7.5 ml) of oil to the hot wok. Add the tofu cubes and cook them for one to two minutes. Flip them and cook for another minute. Continue flipping until the tofu cubes have been browned on every side. Remove the tofu from the wok using the slotted spoon. Place the tofu into the same bowl with the pre-cooked onions. In a small bowl, whisk the egg together with the sesame oil and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of the soy sauce. Add another ½ tablespoon (7.5 ml) of oil to the wok and heat it over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture and swirl it around in the wok until the egg sets.  Flip the egg over when it begins to puff up. Cook it for another minute before removing it from the wok. Transfer the egg to a plate or cutting board and cut it into small pieces. Add the final tablespoon (15 ml) of oil to the wok and give it a moment to heat up. Add the peas, carrots, and the pre-cooked onion and tofu. Fry the vegetables and tofu for about two minutes. You don’t actually have to use any of the vegetables mentioned in the recipe, and you can add or remove ingredients as needed to include your favorite vegetables and spices to add flavor. The recipe needs about 1¾ cups of vegetables, which can include:  One to two cloves of minced garlic  A half-inch (1.3 cm) of freshly grated ginger Red peppers Mushrooms Cabbage  Asparagus Corn or baby corn Bok choy Broccoli Celery Tomato Finally, add the cooked rice, the green onions, and the bean sprouts to the wok. Toss all the vegetables together and let them cook for about three minutes. After three minutes, add the pre-cooked egg and the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of soy sauce. Toss gently to coat everything in the soy sauce, being careful not to break up the egg too much. Cook everything together for about a minute, until the soy sauce is heated through.

It featured a tailored, pleated jacket with a nipped waist and a peplum (a small skirt emphasizing a narrow waist and wide hips) that flared out into a mid-calf length, full skirt made up of several folds.  Instead of the leggy wartime look, the New Look emphasized the bust and hips in an hourglass figure.

Cocktail attire, billed as more elegant than daywear but a step down from formal wear, became popular in the late 1940s for informal or early dinners.  For women, this meant wearing dresses in sumptuous fabrics with a mid-calf or knee-length hem and including elements such as a low-cut bodice,  a short bolero jacket, or a frothy skirt enhanced with tulle or chiffon.

Garters were used to hold up stockings, girdles helped achieve the popular \"nipped waist\" look, and petticoats were sometimes necessary to fill out skirts. Women were reluctant to give up the pants and shorts they'd enjoyed during the war, and retained them in slimmer, more feminine cuts.  Sporty sweaters and jackets were fashionable for men. In response to the longer locks of the war, women again cut their hair shorter and kept it curled, or added bangs. Men wore hair with a \"wet\" look, achieved with pomade or cream, and combed back from the forehead or up into a pompadour. Postwar makeup remained similar to wartime makeup, with the exception of a less-bold lip.  Liner and color followed a natural lip line, instead of the wartime \"Cupid's bow\" look.  Instead, bright nail colors became popular. Horn rimmed glasses came out in 1947 and have been stylish ever since. Eyeglasses became more “cat's eye” shaped for the ladies. As middle-class Americans began to enjoy more leisure time, sportswear became a popular element of US fashion. The boys were back home and they came with souvenirs. This led to a popularity in island themed fashions and home décor. Hawaiian themed parties were popular by the movie stars during the war and now the rest of the nation was catching up.

If you play music, get on every open-mic, local festival, and radio show that will have you and listen to your music. Get your name out there as a reliable worker. Aside from getting as much experience working as you can, you also need to practice and perfect your skills by taking lessons, workshops, or classes related to your craft. Even if you want to be a stand-up comedian, there are craft-centered workshops in which you learn stage-timing and receive feedback from experience joke-tellers. Find a class or workshop in your area and sign up for it. If you don't enjoy the work itself, there'll be no point in getting an agent to help you get more of it. Start building a network of actors or musicians whom you trust and can use for guidance in building a career. You'll be able to use them for craft tips most importantly, but they'll also prove useful when it comes time to meeting agents.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "The \"armor of God\" refers to a set of metaphorical spiritual armor that Christians should wear at all times to protect themselves against Satan.  The whole armor of God is described in Ephesians, 6:10-18. The passage instructs you to \"Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil\" (Ephesians 6:11). In essence, arming yourself with the protection and weapons offered to you by your faith in Christ, will allow you to stand strong and hold out against evil attacks of a spiritual nature. Ephesians 6:14 states, \"Stand, therefore, having girded your waist with truth.\"  The opposite of the truth is a lie, and Satan is often referred to as the \"father of lies.\" Arming yourself with the \"belt of truth\" means protecting yourself from the evils of deception by clinging to the truth. In the Bible, Jesus refuted Satan's temptations in the wilderness with truths from Scripture. You can also do this; quote Scripture to refute the lies of Satan.  To cling to the truth, you must seek the truth in all things and speak the truth to all people, including yourself. Don't let yourself be deceived about anything. The second part of Ephesians 6:14 refers to the \"breastplate of righteousness.\"  \"Righteousness\" refers to the absolute righteousness of Christ, not the halfhearted and fallible righteousness of mankind. Through your faith, you must rely on the righteousness of Christ to protect your heart against spiritual attacks just as a physical breastplate would protect your heart in a physical battle. If Satan tries to tell you that you aren't righteous, quote Romans 3:22, \"This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.\" Ephesians 6:15 instructs believers to \"shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.\"  The \"gospel of peace\" refers to the gospel or good news of salvation. Preparing your feet with the gospel of peace suggests that you will need to take this gospel as you travel into enemy territory. By stepping forward with this gospel, your soul is protected with each step. As Scripture says, \"Seek first the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added unto you.\" This includes spiritual protection from Satan. You are also instructed in Ephesians 6:16 that, above all, you should take \"the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.\" Faith is an absolute essential to have when engaging in spiritual warfare. Like a shield, faith can protect you against otherwise piercing attacks launched by the enemy. When Satan tries to tell you lies about God, remember to keep your faith that God is good, and that He has good plans for you etc. As Ephesians 6:17 states, \"take the helmet of salvation.\"  The salvation spoken of in this passage refers to the spiritual salvation Christ offers through His death and resurrection. A helmet of salvation can be interpreted as the knowledge of spiritual salvation. Just as a physical helmet protects the brain, the helmet of salvation protects the mind from spiritual attacks and false claims that would turn your mind away from God. The second half of Ephesians 6:18 instructs you to take \"the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\"  The sword of the Spirit is directly described in the passage as the Word of God, or the Bible. To yield the sword of the Spirit, you need to have an understanding of the Bible. Your knowledge of scriptures can then be used as a rebuttal to spiritual attacks. Hebrews 4:12 says, \"For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.\" The verses regarding the whole armor of God finish with Ephesians 6:18, which states that you should be \"praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.\"  In choosing these words to wrap up the passage on the armor of God, the Apostle Paul highlights the importance of relying on God for spiritual strength through the practice of steady and ongoing prayer. The Bible tells us to \"pray without ceasing.\" Continually pray over every situation in your life for God's protection and help. The armor of God is a set of tools and protection that God grants believers, but it is the power of God that the believer must ultimately rely on.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Know what the “armor of God” is.

Workplaces are professional atmospheres, so livening up a bit and being friendly and outgoing could set you apart to her from the other people at work. A simple smile or joke is an appropriate form of flirting, and doesn’t cross any professional lines. If she smiles back and goes along with it, you know she’s into it. Alternatively, if she seems standoffish and shuts it down, you know to back off without any embarrassment. Try adding a joke in through a work memo email, or sending her a funny picture via webchat while you’re at work. Make a lighthearted joke about the meeting you both attended earlier in the day. You both have at least one thing in common: work. Use it as a way to start a conversation. Just avoid petty gossip about co-workers. You want to come off as a positive person, not a downer. Also, avoid any inappropriate jokes. Keep things friendly and light. If she gets assigned a big project or has to stay late, offer to stay and help. Ask her if she needs anything, or if there’s anything you can do for her. Being helpful is friendly, but also shows her that you’re interested in spending some extra time with her. If she misses a meeting or isn’t at work on a day you get new equipment or learn a new policy, bring her up to speed with some notes or a quick phone call. Again, you’ll be helping her out, but also showing her that you’re interested in her. Say something like, “I noticed you were out the other day, so I took down some notes during the meeting for you.” You’ll be letting her know you notice when she’s not around, as well. This will be like giving her a gift, but not one too garish or forward. It’s far more understated than giving her flowers, but will still show her you were thinking of her. Plus, it’ll give you a reason to go up and approach her for a conversation about something other than work. The next time you’re headed out for coffee, ask if she wants some. If she does, she’ll tell you her go-to order, and later on, you’ll know exactly what to get her. Plus, it’s yet another opportunity to express interest in her, give her a smile, and offer to do something nice while still staying professional. Public displays of affection in a workplace can make other people feel uncomfortable, and it might be a different co-worker who ends up reporting you to a supervisor. Plus, physical gestures like touching could possibly make her feel uncomfortable as well, which is the opposite of what you want.  Keep things professional, even when flirting. You can be flirtatious without touching her at all. Eye contact, smiles, and glances are just as effective as touching but don’t come with the possibility of coming off too forward or behaving inappropriately. You might also compliment her work ethic. Praise a project she did well recently. Keep things light and more on the prude side, just to be safe. Don’t make any sexual comments, or say anything that she might be offended by. These kinds of comments could lead to negative consequences like harassment suits or complaints filed against you with human resources.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Smile at her.

You can develop and show off a talent you already have, or you can pick up a new one.  Good talents to pick up include playing the piano or guitar, drawing, or dancing. You can find excellent primers on many of these talents right here on wikiHow! An absolute passion for life and an enjoyment of what you have tends to charm the socks off most girls. Be positive and focus on all of the great things that you have. Pursue the things that you want to have in your life. And never hide how happy you are when you are enjoying something that matters to you. You should also show some ambition. Want things for your life. Want more than what you have and work for it, while still appreciating what you do have. She'll like this quality in you. . Girls want to be with someone who encourages them and makes them feel more hopeful about what they can do and what they can have. We all do, right? When she clearly enjoys something, encourage her to pursue it or do it more. When she mentions a dream she has for the future, encourage her and help her to pursue it!  Sometimes, this might mean helping her with homework or at least keeping her company (and focused!) while she studies. Never judge her dreams or make her feel like they're small or worthless. This is the opposite of charming! Girls like to see how much you care. Being guarded with your feelings may help keep your mates from teasing you, but it mostly just makes girls feel like you don't really like them. When you show her how much you care, especially in front of your mates and other women, she'll be totally smitten.  Tell her you love her or bring her flowers when other people are around. Linger when you hug her or hold her hand. Sing a little after a kiss. These are great private communicators of feelings. on her. Look at her eyes when you talk to her. Say her name in conversations, both with her and with others. Be loyal and don't worry about attracting other girls by being flirty or dressing to the 9s. Keeping your focus 100% on her tells her that your feelings are true. Make comments to the effect of \"I'm not interested in attracting any more girls. I have you\". This shows that you're really just interested in her. Never assume that you are entitled to her affection, even if you're dating her. When girls feel like they have to give you their affection, like it's an obligation, then the whole thing quickly loses its romance. Work every day to earn her love and before you know it, you will. Putting others in the spotlight and highlighting the accomplishments of other people shows that you're a team player. It tells her that you're not selfish and that you could share a life with her, just like you share your happiness with others. Instead of turning conversations to be about you, talk about what other people (especially her!) are doing instead. Being kind to her is obvious, right? Of course you want to be nice to her if you want to charm her. But you should also be nice to others as well. When you're mean to other people or talk about them behind their back, she'll start to wonder if you do the same to her or how long it will be until you turn on her. That isn't very charming!   Be friendly with people who struggle socially. One good way to show how kind you are to others is to be friendly and social with those who aren't good at making friends. This is especially effective if you're popular.  Be nice to people who are usually harassed, like homeless people, waiters, or door-to-door salesmen.

Some examples of important documents might be your birth certificate, photographs or videos of you, correspondence (letters and emails) with other people, and old social media posts. Talking to the various people in your life is another excellent way to find information to include in your history. Your family members will be particularly valuable sources since they have known you the longest. Be sure to record the interviews for later use. Many cellphones have a recording function that will help you save your interviews. Once you have conducted your interviews and gathered your materials, you will want to begin reviewing them. Read through the documents you have collected to find important pieces of information that you would like to include in your history. Listen to the recordings or read the transcripts of the interviews you conducted. Use a notebook or word processor to keep track of this information for later use. Try creating a spreadsheet that lists all of the sources that you would like to use. This will help you find them quickly and not lose them. Once you have all of your documentation, you will want to begin thinking about how you would like to organize your history. Ask yourself what events you would like to highlight and which are less important. Determine whether you would like to write about your entire life or a specific period. Answering these questions will help you get a better idea of how to organize your story.  You can organize your story thematically to emphasize important interests or life lessons. For example, if you want to highlight your skills as an athlete, you may only mention the life events that are relevant to that subject. You can also chronologically format your history to tell a sequential story. Start with the earliest relevant event and move forward in time from there. Ultimately, it is up to you how you organize your story, find a style that makes sense and tells your history. Once you have a structure for your history, you will want to begin writing it. Initially, this can be an intimidating prospect. In order to make the process of writing your personal history more manageable, try to write a little every day. If you focus on achieving small goals, over time you will finish your history.  Try setting a timer for 45 minutes and write until it goes off. Then, take a 15 minute break and start writing again once those 15 minutes are up. Repeat this process as long as you feel fresh and engaged in your writing. Find a writing schedule that works best for you. When you have finished writing your history, you will want to edit it. Initially, read it yourself to clean up any typos or errors in the writing. After you have given it a glance, find someone to edit it further. This can be anyone who you trust to do a thorough job of editing. If the story has any juicy details, it should also be someone who you feel comfortable reading it. Although you do not have to accept their edits, it is important to give them a good consideration. If you are publishing your personal history, you will have to work with an editor to get your manuscript ready for publishing.

After sewing this line, trim the edge so that there is only 1/8 inch (3 mm) between the thread line and the raw edge. This stitch will end up being on the bottom of your hem. It should help you maintain an even, consistent roll. Fold the raw edge toward the wrong side of the fabric and press in place using an iron.  While not entirely necessary, pressing the fold in place will make the hem less likely to unroll as you stitch. Fold the fabric so that the bend falls just past your initial row of stitching. You should see your initial stitching along the underside of the fabric but not from the front. Pick up one thread from the fabric and a small stitch from the edge of your fold. Pull the needle through, but do not pull it taut just yet.  Use a small, sharp needle for best results. Doing so will make it easier to pick up single threads along your hem. The stitch made into your fold should be as close to the actual fold as possible. Position it in between your initial line of stitching and the fold itself. The threads you pick up from the front of the actual fabric should be directly above the stitch made into your fold. These threads should also be right above the raw edge. Make sure that you only pick up one or two threads from the fabric. Picking up more will cause the hem to be more visible from the front of the fabric. Each stitch should only pick up one or two threads from the fabric, and the stitches should be spaced roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) apart. Repeat this until you have 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of hem stitching. Lightly pull on the thread in the direction of your stitching. The raw edge should roll itself down into your hem, disappearing from sight.  Use firm pressure, but do not pull tightly. Pulling too tightly can cause the fabric to bunch up. Smooth out any bubbles or bumps with your fingers. Continue stitching along the rest of the hem in the same manner until you reach the end. Knot off the end and cut off any excess thread.  As you get better at the process, you can pull the thread after 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of stitching rather than every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm). If completed correctly, the raw edge should be hidden along the wrong side of the fabric and the hem stitching should be barely visible from the front.

The key benefit to knowing your mind so well is that you can take one glance at something and know instantly if it's of benefit or harm. You may then let go or avoid things that are harmful. It takes time, but it gets more effective the more you practice it––you learn more each time you examine something.  In a relationship context, insight and mindfulness - as the two wings of the bird - are useful everywhere; at work, school, home and all times in between. It has clear uses in empathy - being able to understand the challenges and issues we and other people face, and then relating and acting appropriately.  In a work or business context, insight is also incredibly useful in any area requiring creative thinking as well as conflict resolution. Many of our problematic relationships between co-workers, or between boss and employees arise because we don't understand each other and the pressures both sides experience. It's these pressures and how we interact with them that limit compromise and flexibility, so by applying our insights we can find a middle ground as well as new ideas. In a mental well-being context, there comes a stage in most people's lives that the desires of our chattering mind becomes a common thread in the tapestry of life. As well, the understanding that it makes us unhappy and dissatisfied with what we have dawns upon us. Insight is important here in understanding how to let go of shallow desires by correctly identifying your true needs. As a stress relief tool, eventually what insight helps us to do is to learn what stress actually is, how to let it go of it, as well as forgive it and to become so practiced in both recognizing and letting go that you just release stress without trying. Then you are free of so many of your daily troubles. In a quality of life tool, what insight practices do eventually reveal is that every moment is absolutely unique and new, that every experience is fresh, even when we are tired, depressed and frustrated.

You should also wash your face after exercise to make sure that your sweat doesn't clog your pores or irritate your skin.  Always use lukewarm--not hot--water when you wash your face. Hot water can dry you out and cause flaking as well as irritation. Resist the urge to scrub. Use your fingertips and a gentle touch to wash your face. This will minimize irritation, dryness, and unevenness in your skin tone. Skin moisturizers help to keep you skin from appearing dry, uneven, tight, and flaky. They can also help skin appear more youthful and glowing. Moisturizing properly can also reduce pimple outbreaks. Moisturize right after you wash your face or shower to help keep your skin's natural moisture in. If you are prone to oily skin or clogged pores, look for moisturizers that are \"noncomedogenic\" to help keep your skin clear. Getting rid of dry, flaky skin cells will allow your skin to look more youthful and glowing.Exfoliating scrubs often use microbeads or ground fruit pits to scrub out your pores and remove dead skin. If you have skin issues such as rosacea, extremely sensitive skin, or acne, you might not want to exfoliate, however. Exfoliating scrubs can be irritating to these skin types. Hot showers can strip skin and dry it out, making it appear older and less healthy. Taking shorter, lukewarm showers will help your face stay healthy as well as the rest of the skin on your body. Using an SPF 30 sunscreen daily will help prevent skin damage such as fine lines, wrinkles, and discoloration. The sun can also aggravate acne, so you want to protect your skin. Reapply every few hours if necessary, especially if you are sweating or swimming. If your pores clog easily, try to find a sunscreen that has \"noncomedogenic\" on the label. That means that it is not oil-based and is less likely to clog your pores. Anti-wrinkle creams do not eliminate wrinkles, but they can sometimes mask their appearance to make skin look smoother and younger. You should keep your expectations for anti-wrinkle creams low, but they might help your skin look healthier temporarily. Look for ingredients such as retinol, tea extracts, niacinamide, and Vitamin C. These ingredients may help improve skin elasticity and remove damaged skin cells. Touching your face can spread bacteria and skin oils. These can lead to breakouts, infections, or scarring. If you want clean, clear, and glowing skin, you cannot touch or rub your face. It might be tempting to get rid of pimples through popping them. However, this can simply lead to more acne outbreaks, and you also increase your risk of scarring.

Once you have an idea of what foods you have that may be suitable to donate, you need to look up some local charities. Search for food banks and food drives in your area, and call up to ask how to donate. You can search for your local food banks by using the online search tool of national hunger charities.  There are special apps that help businesses to donate unwanted food.  As an individual, it is best to work with an established charity, either local or national. Carefully pack up your food and then take your packages to your local food bank to deliver them to the staff and volunteers there. They will be happy to see you and accept your donation providing everything is packed well and you have not added in anything that is not an appropriate donation. While you're at the food drive you could find out a little more about the work they do. Often they will be looking for new volunteers to help organise and distribute the donations.  If you have some spare time, why not get involved with the charity and volunteer with them. There are normally a range of volunteering opportunities available. You can also donate excess food to charity if you run a restaurant. Contact a local charity with details about the food you wish to donate, and they will send a truck or van to come and collect from the restaurant. These schemes may also enable you to donate perishable and prepared foods, which will then be frozen or delivered immediately to a local shelter. You can find a list of organisations that perform this service on the US Department of Agriculture's website: http://www.usda.gov/oce/foodwaste/resources/donations.htm You can also donate excess food from a grocery store or food wholesalers. The process is similar to that for restaurants and hotels. You will need to contact a local organisation and give them details on the excess food you would like to donate. The organisation will then arrange to pick up the food directly from you.  You could become a corporate partner of a local or national food charity if you are an organisation that frequently has food waste. Being a corporate partner enables you to make a regular arrangement for donations and may offer your business tax benefits.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Determine what food goods are suitable to donate.

Unfortunately, this strategy can actually make the blemish more visible.

For pimples that are begging for concealer, use a concealer brush to dab just a tiny bit right on top of the pimple, then set with powder.

Acne sufferers will find products that contain skin-clearing salicylic acid, tea tree oil, and other compounds.

Your makeup becomes bacteria-ridden, too, so replace it every six months (three months for mascara). If you’re wearing makeup every day, your skin doesn’t have a chance to breathe.

It is measured in millilitres and is much more complicated to determine that your heart rate. A special test called an echocardiogram (aka echo) is used to determine your heart’s stroke volume.  An echocardiogram uses radio waves to create a picture of your heart so the volume of blood passing through it can be measured.  An echocardiogram makes it possible to make the measurements of the heart that are required to calculate stroke volume. Using the echocardiogram, you will be able to determine the numbers needed for the following calculations. The left ventricle outflow tract is the portion of your heart through which blood passes to enter your arteries. In order to calculate the stroke volume you will need to determine the area the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), and the velocity time integral of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT VTI).  These calculations need to be done by a professional reading an echocardiogram. An expert may use the following equation to determine the area of the left ventricle’s outflow tract: Area = 3.14 (LVOT diameter/2)^2  This way of calculating the area is now beginning to be superseded by more advanced imaging technology. To determine stroke volume, the amount of the blood in a ventricle just before a beat (end-diastolic volume, EDV) is subtracted from the amount of the blood in a ventricle (heart chamber) at the end of a beat (end-systolic volume, ESV). Stroke Volume = EDV – ESV. While stroke volume usually refers to the left ventricle, it can also refer to the right ventricle. The stroke volume of both ventricles is usually equal. To determine your stroke volume index, take the velocity time integral, which is the amount of blood being pumped with each heartbeat and divide it by the body surface area of the left ventricle (in square meters). This formula allows direct analysis of the stroke volume for a patient of any size. Finally, to determine your cardiac output, multiply your heart rate by your stroke volume. This is a relatively simple calculation which identifies the amount of blood your heart pumps in one minute. The formula is Heart Rate x Stroke Volume = Cardiac Output. For example, if your heart rate is 60 bpm and your stroke value is 70 ml, the equation looks like this: 60 bpm x 70 ml = 4200 ml/min or 4.2 liters (1.1 US gal) a minute.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Have an echocardiogram.

Ask yourself if you would say the same things if you were face to face with the person. Just because you are in an anonymous setting doesn’t mean you should act as if there are no consequences to your words. Netiquette is a relative idea depending on where you are and who you are interacting with. If you are chatting with friends, you will probably have different levels of what is acceptable. Everyone will be able to see when you enter a chat room, so greet everyone with a friendly hello. If you join and stay silent, others may distrust you. The purpose of chat rooms is to engage with others, so make sure that you are contributing. It is also polite, especially if you are actively participating in conversations, to say goodbye when you are leaving the chatroom. Other users will remember this and be more likely to be friendly towards you the next time that they see you. This is perceived as shouting by other readers, and is difficult to read. Save capitals for extreme emphasis, and don’t use them in every sentence. This is especially important in chat rooms with a lot of random people. Flooding means sending messages to the chat room one after the other in rapid succession. This keeps others from being able to start conversations, and you will be seen as a chat hog. Flooding a channel will most likely get you kicked. There are chat rooms for almost every interest in the world. This means that you are rebound to come across rooms that discuss or support topics you disagree with. Instead of attacking the members of that chat group, consider moving on to a new community.

There are a variety of common phrases and expressions that have been shortened for use in chats.

But there are a few prominent allergy types that have standard avoidance procedures. If you are allergic to a specific food, check all food labels to ensure that your allergen isn't in a food you're buying. Sometimes common ingredients aren't listed on labels, so talk with your allergist or even a dietician if you are at all unsure of something.

If you have an animal allergy, you don't have to get rid of your family pets. You will, however, have to restrict their movements. Keep animals out of your sleeping area and any rooms you spend a lot of time in. It would also help to remove carpeting to avoid dander buildup.

Also cover any food that is outside to avoid attracting insects. Make sure every doctor you visit is aware of your allergy. Ask about alternatives for medications you are allergic to. Also be sure to wear an emergency medical bracelet to let any emergency medical staff know that you are allergic to certain drugs. You should take your EpiPen with you every time you go somewhere your allergen could be present. Having it handy could save your life if you experience a reaction away from home. Your allergist may recommend one or more medications to treat your allergy symptoms. These can range from OTC antihistamines to prescription corticosteroids. Whatever medications your allergist recommends, be sure to take them on schedule as he prescribes. This will help control your allergy symptoms and lessen your chances of a severe reaction. Some allergens can be treated with allergy shots, or immunotherapy. The process entails gradually desensitizing your body to the allergen by injecting small doses of it.

Taking drama in school can improve interpersonal skills, as well as, mental, physical, and emotional development. Stage and screen acting are in very different environments. Stage acting is a performance in front of a live audience. You'll be given time to rehearse and learn lines more so than on film or in a television show. You’ll learn stage acting in high school drama, but some of these skills also translate to the screen.  Other differences include the ability to vocalize. Acting for television and film, utilizes microphones that are able to pick up minute sounds, while you need to resonate vocally on stage. Costume changes often have to occur much quicker with stage acting. When looking for colleges or universities to attend, consider selecting an acting school. Some of the best schools for drama and the performing arts include The Juilliard School, Yale School of Drama, Carnegie Mellon University, and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts.  Many of the top drama schools require an audition in order to be admitted. Try building a strong portfolio and take all the roles you can get while you're in high school to increase your odds of getting into a performing arts college. The competition for admission is often very fierce and includes filing a lot of paperwork. Don’t shy away from a role if a producer or director thinks you’re a fit for it. If your high-school drama teacher wants you to be the lead role in the play, take the opportunity. In order to build your skills and develop your talent, you need to actively perform in front of an audience.  You may have to perform in unpaid roles until you’re paid as a professional actress. Try to take roles that challenge you and will give you a greater diversity of skill. Roles may require you to be in physically good shape to execute certain maneuvers or fit a certain image for production. Stage acting also takes physical prowess and endurance in order to continue vocalizing lines and doing actions on stage. By maintaining good physical health, you'll prevent casting directors from dismissing you because of the shape you're in.  You obviously don't have to be a size 0, but you need to stay healthy and be able of adapt your appearance. Getting sick may also halt production if you've been cast in a critical role. Make sure to take vitamins and maintain a healthy and balanced diet. Make sure to get enough sleep. While it’s not necessary to learn how to dance, sing, or play an instrument in order to act, these skills will make broaden your range and make you more appealing to casting directors. See if you can take an extra class at a community center or get a special tutor to teach you these skills. Horse riding, archery, gymnastics, diving, martial arts, conjuring, juggling and circus skills are all performance skills that may increase your ability to become a famous actress.  Anna Kendrick, Kristen Bell, and Emmy Rossum can sing, dance and act.  If you want to become a famous musical star, then singing and dancing are usually a necessary talents to have. A great way to see your own progress is by taping yourself everyday to see how your acting skills are developing. Once you’re done with your scene each day, go over the tape and write notes on things that you can do to improve. Practice audition scripts at home, and get friends who act to help you.  Choose scripts in a genre that you find specifically challenging like comedy, romance, or drama, and practice them to hone your versatility. You can also do voice or movement specific exercises to improve specific aspects of your acting ability.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Sign up for acting classes or join a local acting studio.

Their arm should be relaxed with their elbow flexed. Using a firm, circular motion, wipe the injection site with the antiseptic or alcohol swab. Let the injection site dry completely before proceeding.  By allowing the skin to dry completely before inserting the needle, you can prevent alcohol and other pathogens from entering the skin when the needle is inserted. Since intradermal injections do not involve the penetration of major blood vessels, you do not need to aspirate the syringe. Use your non-dominant hand to do this. Place your thumb below the injection site and your middle finger above it. Use these fingers to gently pull the skin taut to ensure easy penetration of the needle. Try to avoid moving the skin to the side or drawing the skin too far back. Use your dominant hand to hold the syringe parallel to the patient’s arm. The bevel should be facing up. Slightly angle the needle so that it is at a 5 to 15 degree angle relative to the skin. Make sure to place your fingers and thumb on the sides of the barrel. If they are underneath the barrel, this can cause the angle of insertion to go beyond 15 degrees. Slowly insert the needle into the patient’s skin until it is ¼ inch (6.35 mm) in, or the entire bevel is under the skin.

Do this as you are administering the medication. A weal or bleb is an area of the skin that is raised like a blister or bubble.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Insight in essence is both knowledge and understanding derived from an \"inward sight\", or more simply, looking inside your own mind and body and observing it. It can be a natural process, or an intentional process as sometimes you need to see things differently to see them clearly, but most important is knowing which lens or style to use to make it clear.  When seeing and studying something, you might gain an understanding on how and why it happens simply by seeing it as it happens and not passing judgement. The more you watch, and the greater your depth of observation, the more information you can pick up. Knowledge is the understanding that is gained and is the part that you can use.  In its simplest example, you might learn that fire is hot, but only through touching its heat. Likewise if you don't remember that it's harmful and use that knowledge next time you reach to pick up something hot, you will burn yourself. The skill is all about developing insight so it becomes more than basic survival skills, but a way to improve skills and our quality of life and learn things on a much deeper level of understanding. General mindfulness and meditation is a classic format when observing the mind and body but also for any subject you wish such as when gazing at a beautiful garden, complex poetry or art or when studying a recipe book, instruction manual or textbook. Its best to be aware that meditation (or any means used to gain an inward perspective) typically consists of two things:  1. The initiation of a laboratory-like or study field literally the moment you pay attention to it. Generally, everyone has practiced observation and had insights of various degrees throughout their life, but it generally is on a superficial level until the person decides to get to the bottom of the matter, or when they have observed so much of the subject it is more apparent. 2. When practiced to the degree of deep focus or absorption, meditation allows the mind to become far more clear, calmed and focused and can look at things without distortions or personal agendas. Seeing a sample under a microscope is a lot more detailed and focused than just looking at the sample in the hand. Developing the mind through meditation as well as other methodologies both sharpen your focus and gives you a clearer boundary on the thing you focus on.  However, it would be inaccurate to conclude that very deep meditation is the only way to the goal itself although it certainly does help. You might see the finer detail through a microscope certainly, but an example to consider is how expert geologists can tell the quality and type of soil in their hand just through the naked eye, or by using specific gravity tests and other chemical analyses. These skills are learned through experience and testing their understanding. They might have used a microscope in their training and career, or they might never have done so. In this instance, it is like a bird with two wings, observation - such as meditation - is one wing, examining and understanding is the other wing. If the bird has only one wing it can't fly well, it will just go round in circles. They typically arise more in an intentional, guided or an intensive style of study practice rather than those rare but life changing insights that simply happen. If you are familiar with them, you can at least recognize them when they happen and if they do pop up, arguably you can learn even more if you turn your attention to these very obstacles.  There is occasionally the idea that \"the means to the end\" is actually the \"end\" itself. The complication here is the process or relationship to the process has become more important than focusing on the subject. This can be quite a common experience many go through and some do end up going to universities and colleges all their life or studying the mind in meditation in a routine style, but never really making any breakthroughs. Try not to rush things. This is another common challenge as people hope to find a magic switch to get full understanding on their subject be it science, psychology, arts & literature and so on, or a cure for their troubles. As the metaphor goes, when the \"penny drops\" in the mind and things make sense, this often takes time to happen naturally. However, repeated observation and testing not only helps the penny drop sooner, but also the extent of the insight is broadened and many different facets can of the same experience can become clear. In this way, a person can learn to think and act more creatively and skilfully. Some also end up stuck with nowhere to go when the insight or knowledge gained is presumed as the goal itself. Insight is just one half of the story, the other half is doing something with it. Consider that a surgeon through his or her experience designs a new scalpel or forceps, but it's only until these tools are used in surgery that they are going to be useful. In the same way, care must be taken to continuously apply and test any insights gained as well as how to use them as practical tools, which in itself can expand the depth of understanding. The application of understanding relationships is most important, and it goes awry when people prefer to focus on the intellectual, rather than the practical. For example a chemist might discover a new medicine through testing samples, but if the treatment is never made available or ever taken by the patient, it does nothing. The medicinal discovery itself does not destroy the disease. In the same way, you have to apply your understanding to achieve the goal, for the discoveries are just a means to an end.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Seek to understand what insight is.

Foam brushes just work a little better. Bristled brushes are fine for small detail work later on. You can paint the pot one solid color, but for more variety or for fun designs, painters tape is a great option. With this variation, you’ll tape and paint over the tape for the first coat. Once the paint dries, you’ll take the tape off and paint the areas that were under the tape before.  You can re-tape over the areas you already painted so you keep the lines betweens colors sharp. Another option is to paint the entire pot with the first color, and then tape the designs you want and paint again over everything so the parts under the tape will stay the original color. You can use any paint you want for the main coats. It’s cheapest to use leftover paint you already have around. Exterior or interior paints are both fine, as well as acrylic craft paint. Spray paint works well,too.  Cover the entire outside of the pot, excluding the bottom. It’s not necessarily harmful to paint the bottom, but it can’t cause the pot to not drain as well as it should. Also paint slightly down the inside because the soil will not go to the very top of the pot, and you most likely don’t want the clay to show. Depending on the paint, the color, and how thick your first coat was, you may want to apply more than one coat to get an even cover. Clay pots also tend to absorb some of the paint, so it’s likely that one coat won’t be enough.  Make sure that each coat is dry before you paint any addition coats. If the paint is not dry, new coats will pull the paint off of the pot. You can use a different color for the second coat if you want to give the pot a shaded look. If you do this, you might want to thin the second coat with water so it is a little more see-through. Another option for further creativity is painting lines, shapes, or pictures on the pot. If you’ll use the pot for a plant with large foliage that hangs down, you probably don’t want to go into great detail. This is where you can make the pot as simple or as detailed as you want. For example, you might want to paint a detailed garden scene or you might want to paint the name of the plant in fancy letters. Acrylic sealer will make sure the paint lasts longer without peeling or cracking. This is especially helpful if the pot will be outside in the elements. Wait to put the final seal coat on until all the paint has completely dried.  This is not mandatory, but your paint job will most likely not last as long if you pass on sealing it.

Educate yourself about unfamiliar environments before you spend time in them, and ensure that you are properly supplied when spending time outdoors.   Frostbite can occur within minutes of exposure to temperatures below freezing, and can even occur in temperatures above freezing in strong winds, wet conditions, or at high altitudes. Prep your home and car with cold-weather survival gear, including warm clothing. Your own behavior and attention to your surroundings will greatly help you avoid frostbite.  Do not smoke or drink alcohol or caffeine in extremely cold weather, as these increase the likelihood of exposure-related injuries. Do not hold body parts in one position for an extended period of time. Recognize that hands and feet account for 90% of frostbite injuries.  Dress and monitor accordingly, making sure skin is covered and your boots and gloves/mittens are sufficient. Keep your head covered, as well as your ears, at all times during cold weather. 30% of your body heat is lost through your head! Stay dry. Wet clothes will greatly increase the speed of heat loss. Do not go outside in cold weather immediately after a bath or shower.  Be sure that skin and hair are fully dry before going out. Aside from the cold itself, be sure to protect yourself from both wind and moisture.  Wear warm clothing, particularly fleece, polypropylene, and wool, and be sure to wear multiple layers when exposed to cold temperatures, especially for extended periods of time.,   For your first layer, wear clothing that will pull moisture away from the skin. Thermal underwear and base layers, cotton socks, and glove liners are all smart options. Avoid restrictive clothing that may cut off or slow blood circulation. In especially cold weather, wear two pairs of socks. For a second layer, wear loose clothing to help maintain body temperature.  The looseness of this layer helps trap pockets of air that can provide insulation to your body.  Choose clothing that resists retaining moisture.  Heavy pants and sweatshirts are the ideal options. The third, exterior layer should be tightly woven and moisture-resistance to repel the elements.  Jackets, hats, scarves, mittens, and boots should all be worn in cold weather. Mittens are a better option than gloves, as they decrease the surface area of your covering that is exposed to the cold.  If you will need to remove your mittens for dexterity, wear gloves underneath. Bring extra clothing with you when you know you’ll be outdoors for a good amount of time, especially on hikes or in other environments away from heated shelters. If your clothing gets wet, make sure you change into something dry. Knowing who is at greater risk will help you recognize frostbite before it leads to a serious injury. Factors that increase the risk of exposure-related injuries such as frostbite include:  Youth and old age.  Monitor the young and old with particular attention. Intoxication.  Drunkenness and cold weather should not be mixed. Exhaustion, hunger, malnutrition, and dehydration. Homelessness, or any lack of consistent access to safe shelter. Other severe injuries, including damaged skin. A previous experience with frostbite. Depression.  Some mental health issues can contribute to increased risk, as those who are despondent or less in tune with their bodies may be less likely to self-monitor their temperature and comfort. Cardiovascular or peripheral vascular disease or poor circulation.  Anyone with medical conditions that affect the regular operation of blood vessels and the vascular system, in general, may be at greater risk.

Working as a team means anticipating needs and offering whatever contributions you can to support the larger goal. As members of the same family and caregivers for the same loved one, set aside petty differences whenever possible and approach each other with compassion and understanding.  Do what you can to help each other, which is certainly what your loved one with AD would have wanted of you. No matter how good your intentions, how great your energy levels, and how determined you are to see things through as a family, the time may well come when caring for an Alzheimer’s patient is simply too much for your family group.  There is absolutely no shame in this.  Always focus on what is best for your loved one with AD, even if that means turning over some amount of care to trained professionals.

They have great flavor, a meaty texture, and contain less liquid than other types of tomatoes.  Look for plum tomatoes that are bright red and firm to the touch.

If plum tomatoes aren't available at your grocery store, dry-farmed tomatoes are another good option.  Use a sharp knife to dice the tomatoes into small cubes. Use a sharp knife to cut the onion into very fine pieces.  Most Mexican cooks use white onions in salsas, as white onions have a sharper taste than red or yellow onions. The sharp taste balances out nicely with the tomatoes in the pico de gallo.  If you can only find red or green onions, feel free to use them instead. Place the diced onions in a bowl and add the juice of half the lime to them. The acid in the lime will tame some of the sharpness in the onions. Use a sharp knife to finely chop up the garlic clove.

Not all pico de gallo recipes use garlic, so if you don't like the taste of raw garlic, feel free to leave this ingredient out. Remove the leaves from the stems and chop them into fine pieces. Cilantro is not everyone's favorite herb. But it is a key element of a good pico de gallo, so be sure to add at least a little cilantro to the dish.

Your child will know the rules and the consequences for breaking the rules. The consequence happens the same every time the rule is broken.  In addition, the consequence applies whether the misbehavior happens at home or in public.  Consistency is vital, and a lack of it can lead to a child developing confusion or willfulness. It’s crucial that all caretakers are on board, disciplining the same way.   When there is a weak link amongst the adults in the child’s sphere, that weakness will be exploited every time. He or she will “shop for a better answer” or play the “divide and conquer” game.  Be sure that the babysitter, Sunday school teacher, daycare or after-school provider, scout leader, grandparents, and other adults who have charge of your child are on board with your desire for consequences that are consistent, immediate, and powerful. Don’t backtrack on consequences.  If you threaten a dire consequence, and the bad behavior occurs, follow through on the promised punishment. If you don’t follow through, your child won’t listen the next time you try to coerce good behavior or prevent bad behavior. This is because you’ll already have a track record in his or her eyes. The consequence for a problem behavior has an immediate impact. It is not delayed. Persons with ADHD often struggle with time concepts, so postponing a consequence has no meaning. It invites an explosion if the child gets a forgotten consequence for a previous infraction that might as well have happened a year ago., If the consequence for speeding was paying a fine of a buck for every mile per hour over the speed limit, we’d all speed constantly. This is not a powerful enough consequence to change our behavior. We tend to monitor our speed to avoid a $200 ticket plus higher insurance premiums. The same applies to children with ADHD. The consequence needs to be powerful enough to act as a deterrent., Your anger or raised voice may cause anxiety or send a message that your child can control you by getting you angry. Remaining calm and loving will convey the message you want. Before taking action, do a self-check to make sure you are responding in the way you want to respond. Your child may ask you ten times to have a special privilege and you say no nine times. But if you finally give in at the end, the message sent and received is that being a pest will pay off. Some kids crave attention badly enough to behave badly so they’ll get it. Instead, reward good behavior with an abundance of attention but consequence bad behavior with limited focus lest your attention be interpreted as a reward! Don’t argue or vacillate. Once you give a specific instruction, it is to be followed without exception, because you are the boss. If you allow your child to argue, he or she sees that as an opportunity to win. Thus, you lose. ,  Don’t talk until your child is focused on you. Make sure your child is making eye contact with you. If you assign a task, make the instructions brief and have him repeat it back to you. Wait for the job to be completed before distracting him with anything else. Many parents use timeout systems but they frequently are not used properly. How many times have you seen a child sent into a timeout for a specified number of minutes then released, time having been served. Instead of a timeout being a prison sentence, use this time  as an opportunity for the child to self-calm and contemplate the situation. Then, he or she will discuss with you how this situation came about, how to resolve it and how to prevent it from happening again in the future. You’ll also talk about consequences if it should reoccur.  Choose a designated spot in your house where your child will stand or sit quietly. This should be a place where he or she cannot see the television or otherwise be distracted. Designate an amount of time to remain quietly in place, self-calming (usually not more than one minute per age of the child). As the system becomes more comfortable, the child might remain in place simply until he or she has achieved a calm state. Then ask permission to come talk it over. The key is to allow the child time and quiet; give praise for a job well-done. Don’t think of timeout as a punishment; consider it a reboot. You need to become as adept at foreseeing the future when you have a child with ADHD.  Anticipate what problems you might encounter and plan interventions to prevent them.

Reflect on your reasons for wanting to end the friendship. Then, tell the person why you don’t want to remain friend based on these reasons. Avoid starting sentences with “you” when you do this as this may cause them to become more defensive.  For example, you might say something like, “I don’t think we should be friends any more. I feel hurt when you never ask me about what’s happening in my life.” Or, you might say, “I think we should take a break. I feel sad when you criticize my looks and pressure me to change things about myself.” “I” statements are less likely to cause your bestie to feel defensive, so it’s important to craft what you want to tell your best friend in this format. to their response, but remain firm in your decision. After you have said how you feel, they might want to respond. Be willing to listen to them, but stick with your decision. Don’t allow them to sway you if you’ve made up your mind about breaking up with your best friend. Make eye contact with them, nod your head to show you’re paying attention, and put away anything that might distract you, such as your phone. Try to keep your body language open while you listen to them, too, such as by facing them, keeping your arms at your sides, and leaning in towards them. It is possible that your best friend will want to hash out the details of why you are breaking up with them, but this is unlikely to resolve anything. If they start to drag out past arguments or a list of their perceived wrongs, stop them and excuse yourself. For example, you could say, “I don’t want to get into this because I don’t think it will solve anything.” Try saying something to indicate that you mean the person no ill will, even though you don’t want to remain friends.

There may also be behavioral requirements related to being on the honor roll. So make sure you behave well and treat others with respect. You can also try talking to your guidance counselor to find out more about what it takes to meet the honor roll requirements. Some courses (such as honors or AP classes) are given extra weight in your GPA calculations. This is intended to make up for the difference in grades based on the amount of effort it takes to achieve them. You need to keep this in mind when choosing your classes.  In most schools, you can still be on the honor roll without taking honors or AP classes. So it might be a smarter idea to take the regular classes where you have a better chance of making an A. However, if you plan on attending college, taking AP classes is important. So it’s probably worth the extra effort to take the honors/AP classes. For example, you might have to work really hard to make a B in an AP class whereas you could have made an A in the regular version of the same class. It is easy to think of the honor roll as a holistic performance evaluation, but you need to also consider the smaller parts that make up the whole. Making good grades in each individual assignment is just as important as thinking about the whole picture.  Keep track of upcoming tests, quizzes and exams so that you can plan to study them.

This is important so that you can keep track of what areas you need to focus on and how much. It can also be helpful to calculate the grade you’ll need on major assignments to maintain or raise your GPA.

Take a crayon or marker, and draw a line on both legs to show how tight you want them to be. Remember to make the line on the inside so when you wear them you can't see the seams on the outside of the leg. Make sure you draw the line on the opposite side of the manufacturer's original seam. You can use pins to tack, but you might end up poking yourself or the pins might end up coming out when you take the jeans off. As an alternative, take a pair of skinny jeans you already own as a guide. Spread out the pair you want to reconstruct inside-out and lay the skinny jeans on top (lining up the crotch). Make sure the seam is evenly on the edge (of both pairs) and take your chalk down the side of your pants, starting about mid-thigh, mirroring the line of the skinnies. Iron your jeans first to make everything easier. Flat, unwrinkled jeans are easier to work with. Walk around in them to see that the legs fit well, or you may want to jog a little -- sometimes jeans can come loose if you start moving around, in which case you'll need to tighten them. If you're unhappy, remove the stitches. But if they're tight, short, and spaced closely so that there are no bumps in your jeans and the stitches won't be pulled out in the wash, you're good to go. Work over each stitch as perfectly and as carefully as you can -- there's nothing worse than having a brand new pair of skinny jeans for one day and then having the stitches all pulled out the next. This will be hard work, but it is essential. Cut any excess fabric if necessary (use a zigzag stitch beforehand) or go over it with a serger, which will seal off the edge and cut off the fabric at the same time. However, you might want to wear and wash your jeans at least once before you start cutting them up, in case you want to go back and fix something later on.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Put on your jeans to get an idea of the shape you want.

{"contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Neither personality type is better nor worse than the other. During current times, extroverted qualities tend to be lauded as people clamber up the corporate ladder, and in many places, announcing one's presence loudly and selling one's skills to the world is considered to be an essential part of succeeding in competitive job and sales arenas, something many introverts find challenging (although not impossible). However, quiet personalities are as valid and important as their noisier counterparts, they just don't like taking center stage as often. What tends to occur however, is that some people are more extroverted and others are more introverted, with some \"central flexibility\" where the two traits cross over. The trait may be evident in just some situations, or in any situation, depending on the individual. Each person is made up of many aspects, with introversion or extroversion being two parts of a greater whole. However, what does happen is that you have a tendency for either one or the other trait and this in turn affects how you balance your time, your social interactions and your recharging needs.  Expression of the extent of introversion is situationally dependent. Some people are at the extremes of either introversion or extroversion. Life can be a lot harder for these people than those who have a more \"balanced\" leaning towards either tendency. That doesn't mean they are not \"normal\", it does mean they are more likely to experience problems in social contexts where people carry certain expectations of \"typical\" behavior and interaction. The term \"ambiverts\" is used for persons who display fairly equal amounts of both introversion and extroversion. However, this may just be that the person is either one or the other but is moderate in the expression of the more dominant trait, yet feels comfortable with expressing both. While neat boxes are often tempting to apply, the human personality is far too complex for such an approach. Both with yourself, and with others, avoid the tendency to think that the personality trait defines the whole. It does not, and cannot. Much more goes into making up your personality as a whole, along with social skills that you can learn.  Just because a person is considered to be an introvert doesn't mean that that person cannot be in charge, powerful, in the spotlight, etc. There are plenty of renowned introverts who are known as great leaders, inspirers and change-makers. An extrovert will sometimes make use of taking time to reflect, to think things through and to be at peace in solitude, when needed; it just isn't as pressing or important to the extroverted personality to spend extended periods of time in such modes. However, just as an introvert should not be labeled as \"all or nothing\", neither should the extrovert be so labeled. This is both unfair and impolite. Introverts will participate in social occasions and are as likely to be friendly, outgoing and articulate (all personality skills or traits that are learned or innate but that have nothing to do with whether one is an extrovert or an introvert) as the next person. Every human being appreciates contact with others, it is simply a case of how much contact, with whom and for how long. Introverts are more likely to manage the interactions to minimize the exhaustion or overwhelming feelings that can occur, at least for those introverts who have recognized the reality for themselves.  Both extroverts and introverts are equally capable of learning and applying social skills, just as the opposite is true and both can be socially inept; skills are a separate issue from personality traits. Many introverts are employed in careers that involve a lot of interaction with different people; what you will discover is that they have carefully managed systems in place to be able to cope with the constancy of interaction. For example, they may schedule only a few daily appointments; they may decline any after-work functions that are not a good investment of their time for the expected return. An introvert is less likely to indulge in social events as a form of escapism or habit but thinks through the benefits before wading in. As we grow older, we tend to mellow and some of the more evident extremes of either introversion or extroversion become less marked and both personality types shift into a more middle zone. This allows extroverts to access more reflective states, while it also allows introverts to find their voice and stand up for the things they find matter. Much of this stems from the wisdom that comes with experience, provided a person learns the lessons and feels secure in their life.\n\nProvide a summary of the article in two or three sentences:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Avoid assuming that introverts or extroverts are unequal.
